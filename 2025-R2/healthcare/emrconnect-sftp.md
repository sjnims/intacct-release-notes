# Enhanced connections and value transformations in EMRConnect

EMRConnect works with most delimited flat files that are exported from EMR (electronic medical records) systems. You can set up field mappings for as many formats as you need.

We've recently made EMRConnect even better with the following enhancements:

-   Refine the set of data for a value transformation by configuring the value transformation with the condition **Not Equals**.
-   Improve access control and security by using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) connections made through a proxy.

Company and Administration

Starting May 2025, all customers who send emails using a custom domain must authenticate and validate their domain with the enhanced email delivery service.

This is a non-negotiable requirement as we transition fully to the enhanced email delivery service.

## Why is this important?

Authenticating your domain helps ensure that your email communications are secure and reliable.

- Improved email deliverability, reducing the chances of your messages being marked as spam or not reaching recipients.
- Protects your domain from being used in phishing attacks or other fraudulent activities.
- Aligns with best practices for email security and compliance.

To ensure smooth email delivery to customers and partners, authenticate your domain during May 2025 or within the following single release.

## How it works

Your Intacct administrator will need to work with your email administrator to obtain the DNS keys and other information for your domains.

[Step 1. Add and authenticate your domain](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Enhanced_email_service_Step1_authenticate)

[Step 2. Add DNS keys to your configuration](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Enhanced_email_service_Step2_DNS_config)

[Step 3. Validate your domain](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Enhanced_email_service_Step3_validate)

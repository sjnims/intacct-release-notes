# Package type field and Demo option removed from consoles

[Instances](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Aa_toc_instances)

Consoles

Sage Intacct updated the options available when you create an instance.

- We removed the **Package type** field from Accountant consoles to streamline usage tracking.
- We removed the **Demo** option because demo companies remain active for only a limited period.

If you have a **Demo** company type, your company type will change to **Sales demo** automatically. When you create an instance, you can use the **Sales demo** option from the Instance company type field instead. The Sales demo company type ensures that your new instance remains active and accessible for as long as you need it.

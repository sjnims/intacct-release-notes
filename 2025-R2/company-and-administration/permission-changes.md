## Updated

We've updated aspects of the following permissions.

### Accounts Payable

-   **Adjustments:** Add, Post
    
    Previously, only the Adjustments Add permission was required to import posted AP adjustments using CSV import. Now, the Adjustments Add and Post permissions are required.
    

### Accounts Receivable

-   Invoices**:** Add, Post
    
    Previously, only the Invoices Add permission was required to import posted invoices using CSV import. Now, the Invoices Add and Post permissions are required.
    
-   **Adjustments:** Add, Post
    
    Previously, only the Adjustments Add permission was required to import posted AR adjustments using CSV import. Now, the Adjustments Add and Post permissions are required.
    

### Projects, Time, and Expenses

Previously, Time and Expenses were a single application. Now, they are 2 separate applications that each have their own set of permissions. The separation has also impacted the Projects permissions, with some permissions moved to either the Time or Expenses permissions.

### Projects and Time

-   **My timesheets**, **Staff timesheets**, **Approve timesheets**, **Timesheet rules**, **Time types:** List, View, Add, Edit, Delete
    
    Previously, these permissions affected both the Projects and Time applications. Now, these permissions affect the Time application only.

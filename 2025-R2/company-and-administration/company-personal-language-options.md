# Language support for Spanish and Canadian French-General availability

We've added two new languages, Spanish and Canadian French. The new language options are available in both the Company preferences page and User preferences page.

## Details

Setting the language preference at the Company level changes the language for all the users in your company. Setting the language preference at the User level changes the language just for that user.

When you set your Intacct local language, the following areas appear in your preferred language:

- Sage Intacct User interface
- Help Center
- Community
- Release notes

However, the following will not change:

- Custom terminology
- User data
- Platform applications
- Marketplace applications

## How it works

### To change your personal language preference

1. Select your login name at the top of any page and choose **My preferences**.
2. Scroll to the General preferences section.
3. Select **Language** and choose a language.
4. Select **Save**.

### To change your company language preference

1. Go to **Company** > **Setup** > and select **Company**.
2. Select **Edit**.
3. Scroll to the Global settings section.
4. Select **Language** and choose a language.
5. Select **Save**.

## Permissions and other requirements

Requirements apply to changing your company preferences. You do not need special permissions to change your personal preferences.

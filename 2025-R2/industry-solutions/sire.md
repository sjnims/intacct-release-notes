## A better way to reorganize property records

With the new **Move Property** feature, you can transfer all property-related records and data—including units, tenants, and leases—to a new Property entity.

Data integrity is ensured because the entire property structure is replicated, with all existing data and attachments transferred as-is to the newly selected property.

## Improved handling of interest on security deposits

We've improved how interest on security deposits is calculated and credited, increasing transparency and clarity while still ensuring compliance.

-   You can define the interest rate for security deposits in a new Interest Rate section in your settings.
-   Interest accrues from the date of deposit until the deposit is refunded, aligning with real-world financial practices.
-   Interest earned on the deposit is included in the final refund when the deposit is returned to the tenant.
-   For partial refunds, interest is calculated proportionally to ensure fairness.

## Straight line rent

For leases with escalating rents, you can use the new **Straight Line Rent** feature to automatically calculate an equalized payment amount based on the total rent for the lease term. Equalizing the payment amount over the lease term simplifies accounting and ensures smoother financial management.

Rent payments are automatically adjusted based on the lease start and end dates, ensuring accurate prorated amounts during periods of change.

## Details

Subledger Reconciliation Assistant speeds up your subledger reconciliation processes with the following features:

- **Automation**: Automate time-consuming reconciliation tasks, allowing finance teams to focus on strategic priorities rather than manual reconciliations.
- **Variance visibility**: Quickly identify entities with discrepancies at a glance.
- **Drill-down insights**: Drill into variances for detailed transaction-level visibility.

## How it works

Subledger Reconciliation Assistant goes through the following steps to help with your close process: 

1.  Scans entries to find variances between the subledgers and General Ledger and lets you know if a variance is found.
2.  Provides guidance to help you investigate the variance.
3.  Generates the Subledger Reconciliation report that you can use as a reconciliation worksheet during your close process.

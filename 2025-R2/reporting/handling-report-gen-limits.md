# Optimize the performance of your financial reports

Reporting & Insights

When you save a report in Financial Report Writer, Intacct will analyze your report and potentially offer recommendations to make the report run faster. Or, based on the nature of the report, Intacct might suggest a better way to accomplish your goal.

## Details

When you save a report in Financial Report Writer, you'll see a message if Intacct finds any of the following in the report:

-   More than 12 columns
    
-   Four or more expanded columns or rows
    
-   An expanded column with a "... to date" reporting period, such as prior year to date
    
-   A column that's expanded by a dimension with more than 100 values
    

The message will contain suggestions on how to optimize the report. If you're running data analysis that goes beyond a simple report, running the report offline can be the best option. Alternately, a different reporting tool might work better, and Intacct will provide links so you can learn more about them.

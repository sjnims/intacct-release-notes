Expenses

Previously, Time and Expenses was a single application. Time and Expenses is split into two individual applications: **Time** and **Expenses**. The subscription still includes both applications but you access them using dedicated menus.

This change ensures that features are easier to find and navigate, providing a smoother experience with Sage Intacct.

To see and use the new Time application, you must enable the Time subscription and assign permissions to users and roles.

## Enable Time subscription

1.  Go to **Company** > **Admin** tab > **Subscriptions**.
    
2.  Toggle on **Time and Expenses**.
    

If you were subscribed to the Time and Expenses application, you now access Time features in the new Time application and the Expenses features in the new Expenses application.

## Assign new permissions to roles and users

The Time and Expenses applications each have their own separate set of permissions. Assign the appropriate permissions to users so that they can complete tasks related to each application. Learn more about [Application permissions.](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=TOC_application_permissions)

[Ensure your permissions have transferred correctly](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2025/2025_Release_2/Expenses/2025-R2-ex-time-expenses-split-into-two.htm#)

Previously, you could assign the following permissions in both of the Projects and Time and Expenses applications: My timesheets, Staff timesheets, Approve timesheets, Timesheet rules, and Time types

-   If you assigned permissions in the Projects application only, then those permissions have transferred to the Time application successfully.
    
-   If you assigned permissions in the Time and Expenses application only, then those permissions have transferred to the Time application successfully.
    
-   If you assigned permissions in both of the Projects and Time and Expenses applications, then ensure that the correct permissions have transferred to the Time application.
    

### Assign Expenses permissions to roles

4.  Select the checkboxes for the activities and reports to access.
    
5.  Select **Save**.
    
6.  Select **Save** again.

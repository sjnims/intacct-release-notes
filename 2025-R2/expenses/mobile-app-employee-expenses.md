Expenses

The Sage Intelligent Time mobile app now supports employee expense automation so that you can capture receipts, submit expense reports, and approve or decline them from a mobile device quickly. This enhancement aims to boost efficiency, reduce errors, and quicken reimbursements for employee expense reports.

This is a closed Early adopter program. If you would like to be considered for the Early adopter program, [fill out this short questionnaire](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=fN0yPvZBLUmho8WOsCz0-C5eEXViCBxKjteqhXSbhsxUODhZS1VGVjNOODdRVzhMS1VVSUJSQllMVC4u).

## Details

Previously, the Sage Intelligent Time mobile app allowed you to manage timesheets and time clocks only. Now, you can do the following using the Sage Intelligent Time mobile app:

-   Create, edit, delete, split, and submit expense reports
    
-   Upload, edit, and delete expense receipts
    
-   Create and edit time clocks
    
-   Create and submit timesheets
    
-   Approve or decline expense reports and timesheets
    

To use expense receipts, ensure that you enable electronic receipt inbounding. For more information, go to [Automate employee expenses.](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Automate_employee_expenses)

You cannot manage staff expense reports using the mobile app. Use Sage Intacct to manage staff expense reports. Go to [Expense reports](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=TOC_your_expenses) for more information.

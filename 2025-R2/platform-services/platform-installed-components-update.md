To improve your experience when using Platform features, we've hidden the **Installed components** menu option from the main Platform menu. You can continue to view installed components in the individual applications' overview pages.

We made this update to simplify the menu based on customer usage. If you prefer to retain the **Installed Components** option in the main Platform menu, ask your designated support user [to log a Support case](https://www.sage.com/en-us/support/resources/).

# REST API Bulk Request Service—General Availability

[Bulk and composite request services](https://developer.sage.com/intacct/docs/developer-portal/guides/bulk-requests/#bulk-requests)

platform services

Generally available as of 2025 Release 2, the bulk service enables scalability by handling large-scale non-blocking data processing.

In addition, it can process multiple operations for one REST object with a single HTTP call. The bulk service runs asynchronously. The service provides two functions: file upload to submit a bulk request for asynchronous processing, and job status to get the status of asynchronous jobs.

# Other updates to AP Automation

This release brings the following updates to AP Automation.

## Support for Advanced Audit Trail

For companies that use Advanced Audit Trail, you can now subscribe to AP Automation, including the extension to Purchasing, to automate incoming transactions.

Advanced Audit Trail track access to personal data stored in contact, customer, and vendor records to comply with data protection laws, such as HIPAA.

## Project dimension predictions—Open Beta

Now the Project dimension will populate in transaction line items when AI/ML has high confidence in its prediction. This field is left blank when AI/ML confidence is low.

Corrections you make to Project are fed back to the ML system when you post the transaction. The AI/ML learns over time to improve predictions.

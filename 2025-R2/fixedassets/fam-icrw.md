FIXED ASSETS MANAGEMENT

We're excited to announce that Interactive Custom Report Writer (ICRW) now supports Fixed Assets Management.

We’ve added a prebuilt report—titled Assets, Depreciation, and NBV—to the ICRW Report Library to help you analyze fixed assets data quickly and accurately. You can also build your own custom reports using Fixed Assets Management objects to meet your organization’s unique needs.

ICRW requires a separate subscription. For information on attaining an ICRW subscription, [contact your Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

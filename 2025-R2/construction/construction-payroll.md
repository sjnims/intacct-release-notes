CONSTRUCTION

Sage Intacct Construction Payroll handles construction payroll complexities not found in general payroll solutions. It provides a complete view of your project costs with unprecedented visibility into each cost component.

For more information, talk to your [Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

This release includes the following new features and enhancements.

## Simplify construction payroll

-   Easily access payroll setup information for employees and projects in Intacct setup pages.​
-   Construction Payroll setup tables available in Custom Report Writer and Interactive Custom Report Writer for advanced reporting.​
-   Approved timesheets can be sent directly to Construction Payroll, streamlining payroll processing.

## Improved performance

We’ve improved performance for creating and retrieving configuration items, timecards, and checks.

## Expanded data syncing

-   The following data is synced between Construction Payroll and other Intacct applications:
    
    -   Jobs
    -   Cost types
    -   Cost codes
    -   General ledger accounts
    -   Entities
    
    For example, new jobs and cost codes that are created in Intacct are available in Construction Payroll.
    
-   By default, payroll data is now automatically available for Intacct reporting.
    
    You can continue using the manual process of selecting **Send Reporting Data** in the Checks page. To do so, contact your Sage partner or enter a support ticket for Sage Intacct Construction Payroll.
    

## Improvements for timecards

-   In the Timecards page, you can review employee timecards using the work week that's defined in the Pay Groups page.
-   For timecards, we've expanded and improved the automated checks that the system performs to help ensure that job cost distributions are valid and active.

## Check stubs provide more information

Check stubs now include the following information:

-   Year-to-date amounts for all employee taxes.
-   Pre-tax and post-tax 401k amounts shown separately along with the employer address.

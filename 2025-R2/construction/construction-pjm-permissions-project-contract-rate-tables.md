Construction

We expanded project manager capabilities to include full access to project contract rate tables. Project managers can now do the following:

-   Add new contract rate tables
    
-   Edit and view existing rate tables
    
-   Delete rate tables that are no longer in use
    

Previously, project managers did not have these permissions.

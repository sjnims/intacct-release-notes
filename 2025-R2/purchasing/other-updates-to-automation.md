# Other updates to AP Automation with Purchasing

This release brings the following updates to AP Automation with Purchasing.

## Support for Advanced Audit Trail

For companies that use Advanced Audit Trail, you can now subscribe to AP Automation, including the extension to Purchasing, to automate incoming transactions.

Advanced Audit Trail track access to personal data stored in contact, customer, and vendor records to comply with data protection laws, such as HIPAA.

## Change in sequence numbering requirements

Document sequence numbering is no longer required for transaction definitions that you select to automate. This gives you more flexibility with the automation, allowing you to add document numbers after the draft is generated.

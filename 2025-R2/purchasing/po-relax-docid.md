# Change in document number requirements

[Draft, post, and save](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=draft_save_post)

PURCHASING

Increase your transaction workflow efficiency. To align with upcoming automation requirements and ensure consistency across applications, Sage Intacct now permits users to save draft purchase transactions without a document number. This change ensures more efficiency in completing your transaction workflows, and greater flexibility during purchase transaction processing.

## Details

By relaxing the document number requirement in draft sales transactions, you'll be able to leverage additional document tracking options: 

- Save transactions in draft state when you are not sure of the document number.
- Automatically assign draft transactions the next sequence number. To avoid any confusion, the document number field is not visible until the draft is saved.

After a document number is assigned to a draft document, it cannot be changed.

- If you convert sales transactions that automatically use the source document number, you can change or delete the number when saving as a draft.

## How it works

When entering new transactions, purchasing clerks can improve their efficiency by entering new transactions with less required information.

Additionally, accounting managers have greater flexibility in information gathering prior to posting: Identify parent documents more easily, quickly track transactions using source document number retrieval, or merge several purchase orders into one invoice and update the draft later.

Looking for a specific draft transaction without a document number? The Transaction history tab displays a record number for all draft documents saved without a document number.

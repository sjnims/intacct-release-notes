ADVANCED REPORTING

The new Interactive Custom Report Writer (ICRW) Reload Server Metadata option allows you to refresh your ICRW session to immediately see newly created custom fields and user-defined dimensions.

ICRW requires a separate subscription. For information on attaining an ICRW subscription, [contact your Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

## Details

The new ICRW Reload Server Metadata option refreshes the session connection between ICRW and its metadata. This is particularly useful when adding new custom fields or user-defined dimensions to Sage Intacct. Reload Server Metadata ensures that the new custom field or user-defined dimension is reflected in ICRW immediately.

The Reload Server Metadata option is only available for ICRW reports that are based on a single reporting area. This feature is not available for ICRW reports created with custom SQL.

For instructions on how to use the Reload Server Metadata feature, see the following topics:

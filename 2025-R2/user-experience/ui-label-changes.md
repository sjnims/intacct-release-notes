# User interface changes

In this release, we updated aspects of the user interface throughout Intacct for clarity and consistency.

| Product area | Change description | Old UI | New UI |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accounts Payable | To add a user to a bill approval policy, you now select the User rule type and then select the specific user. | Previous way:                                                                                                                                                                                                               In the Rule type column, select <Named user> | New way:                                                                                                                                                                                                               In the Rule type column, select User level                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In the User column, select a specific user |
| On the Accounts Payable menu, we renamed a label to better reflect its functionality. | View payment requests | Payment requests |
| Company | We added a dialogue that shows how many remaining sandbox refreshes are available. | A count of remaining sandbox refreshes was not displayed. | When Refresh is selected, a dialogue opens and shows your remaining refreshes or indicates if you need to request more. |
| We added the ability to import inter-entity account mappings directly from the Import data page (Company > Setup > Configuration > Import data). | You can still import inter-entity account mappings from the following pages:                                                                                                                                                                                                               Company > Setup > Configuration > Inter-entity account mapping                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Company > Setup > Configuration > Entities > Entity | Now, you can use the Import data page to do the following:                                                                                                                                                                                                                Download the template for importing inter-entity account mappings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Import your inter-entity account mappings using a CSV file. |
| Contracts | We renamed a tab on contracts to account for its new features. | Billing transaction history | Contract summary |
| Fixed Assets Management | We  renamed field labels to better reflect the field values. | Journal entries no. | Journal entry no. |
| Disposal journal entries no. | Disposal journal entry no. |
| Accumulated depreciation | Total accumulated depreciation |
| You can now add the Book ID column to the Post depreciation list using the Configure columns option. | The Book ID column wasn’t available to add to the Post depreciation list. | The Book ID column is available to add to the Post depreciation list. |
| We removed the Disposal GL account field from the Disposal details section on assets because it's already  in the Asset classification section. | The Disposal GL account field appeared in the Disposal details section. | The Disposal GL account field now only appears in the Asset classification section. |
| On the Depreciation Schedule tab of disposed assets, we made the Journal entry no. field a link. Selecting the link opens a popup with details about the journal entry. | You couldn't drill down from the Journal entry no. field. | You can drill down from the Journal entry no. field to view details. |
| Platform Services | We made this change to simplify the menu based on customer usage. | The Installed components menu option is hidden from the main Platform menu. | You can still see installed components in the individual application's overview pages. |
| Supplies Inventory | On the Issues list, we moved the Print pick list option to align with the actions in the More menu. | Print pick list button | More > Print pick list |
| On the Configure Inventory page, we renamed labels to better reflect functionality. | Supplies PO | Supplies purchase transaction definition |
| Supplies direct ship | Supplies direct-ship transaction definition |
| On the Supplies workbench, we changed a line status option to better reflect specific field information. | Need ship-via | Need shipping method                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Need delivery method |

# New features for Sage Intacct Paperless

[Sage Intacct Paperless](https://preview.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Paperless_for_construction)

Construction

Improve and modernize your paper-heavy accounts payable document workflow. Sage Intacct Paperless is an intelligent, automated solution that allows you to capture, index, route, and store documents in one secure place.

In this release, you can find these new features:

- Invoice **search**: The document search page has been enhanced to allow users to search invoice data stored in the APFlow™ module. Users can also search on processor, exported or non-exported status, and save their search criteria for future use.
- **Report scheduler**: Users can now automate report runs using specified report parameters and schedule the report to be emailed to themselves.
- **Next** invoice: This quality-of-life enhancement automatically loads the next invoice in the APFlow™ Unprocessed Queue after an invoice is routed, improving efficiency when entering invoices.
- **Credit card importer optimizations**: We've improved the Credit card importer for better performance, enabling it to process significantly larger credit card transaction files.
- **Internationalization**: We've added a date format and time zone setting at the user level. These settings ensure that date values within the program and reports follow the user's configured preferences. We've also added a currency setting at the value level. Updating this setting changes the currency symbol used throughout the program for the "amount" values.
- **Custom fields and Manage entry fields**: We've added the ability to add custom fields to the APFlow™ entry pages. You can now configure settings such as width, display name, and formatting options for both custom and standard fields. These fields and settings are respected throughout Sage Intacct Paperless, including Invoice entry, Approve invoices, and Credit card importer. They are also available to build routing and validation rules for custom entry and routing workflows.
- **Copy APFlow™ Value settings**: The Copy Value page now includes new settings that allow you to copy routing rules, validation rules, custom fields, entry page configurations, and user permissions for APFlow™ across vaults. These options improve performance when setting up new vaults.
- **Reviewer route**: Reviewers can now add additional recipients mid-route during the approval process. This enhancement speeds up approvals by allowing reviewers to add missing recipients without rejecting the invoice back to the processor and restarting the route. This permission can be set at the individual reviewer level.
- **Multiple POs on a single** invoice: We've added the ability to code a single invoice to multiple Purchase Orders.
- **Filter location and department by user assigned entities or departments**: This feature filters the list of entities and departments available during invoice entry based on security configurations in Intacct.

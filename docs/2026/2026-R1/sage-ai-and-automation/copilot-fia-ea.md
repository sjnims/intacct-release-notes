# Finance Intelligence agent—Early Adopter

The Finance Intelligence agent is your Sage Ai-powered partner that helps you find answers about your financial data and complete tasks faster. Using Sage Copilot, you can ask questions, get insights, analyze data, and take actions all by using natural language.

## Key benefits

The Finance Intelligence agent enables you to:

- Retrieve and aggregate data instantly across your financials.
- Perform analysis to uncover what’s driving the numbers.
- Get predictions and recommendations for better decision-making.
- Understand the “why” behind every answer with clear, transparent reasoning.

## How it works

You interact with the Finance Intelligence agent by using Sage Copilot. You "chat" with it using natural language prompts.

For example, you could ask it to "List the top 5 vendors with overdue bills and show the total outstanding amount per vendor."

You can view additional analysis of the response, which might include a supporting table, chart, and insight summary. It also includes a “How Copilot worked this out” tab that explains how the answer was derived.

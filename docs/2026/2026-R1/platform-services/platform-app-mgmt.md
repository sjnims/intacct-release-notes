# Application management updates—Beta

[Application management—Beta](https://preview.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Application_mgmt)

platform services

In 2025 R4, we released Application management—beta. Application management contains a robust interface for publishing, updating, and managing application versions across multiple companies. In this release, based on your feedback, we've further improved the feature.

## What's changed

- A banner displays when a new application version you're subscribed to is available for installation.
- The latest application version auto-installs when authorizing subscriptions for client companies; **Is pull allowed** must be enabled.
- **In progress** is no longer an installation status.

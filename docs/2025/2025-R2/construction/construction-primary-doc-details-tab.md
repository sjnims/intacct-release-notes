# New Primary document details tab in Purchasing

The new Primary document details tab is designed for a more efficient and organized approach to managing your purchasing order document and invoices.

You can now quickly view and modify purchasing order documents and invoice-related details. The new details tab is available on primary documents with the Order template type.

These fields are not yet available in CRW, ICRW, or in the printed doc template. These are planned for a future release.​

- **Update totals:** Totals automatically update when an invoice posts to AP or a new change order is added.
- **Refresh all data:** Select this button to manually update totals.

**Primary document summary**

View a summary of all transactions for the document, then scroll to the details where you can drill into AP bills, retainage release bills, and AP payments.

Consoles

Previously, after you created an instance or console template, the State column defaulted to Ready. Now, after you create an instance or console template, the State column displays Ready, In progress, or Failed.

We enhanced the State column so that you can monitor the creation process of instances and console templates to ensure they're created successfully.

## Details

Intacct updates the State column for instances and console templates with information about the state of the creation process.

The State column displays the following information:

- **Ready**. The instance or console template is ready to use.
- **In progress**. The instance or console template is in the creation process.
- **Failed**. The creation of the instance or console template is unsuccessful.

## Monitor the state of instances

1. Go to **My practice** or **Console setup** > **All** > **Instances**.
2. View the State column.

## Monitor the state of console templates

1. Go to **My practice** or **Console setup** > **All** > **Templates**.
2. View the State column.

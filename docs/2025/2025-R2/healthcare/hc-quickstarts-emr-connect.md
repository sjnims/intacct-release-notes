# New dashboards for EMRConnect

Sage Intacct EMRConnect integrates data from your electronic medical records (EMR) or practice management system with Sage Intacct. By connecting financial and operational data, organizations can proactively manage costs and streamline processes—all in one easy-to-use platform.

The following Intacct dashboards are available for EMRConnect subscribers:

- EMR Residential Care Insights
- EMR Ambulatory Care Insights

If your company was created using the General or Nonprofit QuickStart template, you can install these dashboards from the Dashboard library.

## Details

These new dashboards use data from your EMR system to deliver real-time financial and operational insights that help improve budgeting, cost control, and decision-making. Use these dashboards to monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that include the following:

- Number of patient encounters
- Clinician efficiency
- Location performance

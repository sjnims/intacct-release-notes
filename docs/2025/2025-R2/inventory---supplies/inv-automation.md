# Enhancements to Advanced Kit Assembly for Sage Intacct Inventory Automation

[Sage Intacct Inventory Automation](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=inventory-automation)

INVENTORY CONTROL

Advanced Kit Assembly for Sage Intacct Inventory Automation helps you manage kits and bills of material, and the component items used to create them. You can automatically assemble kits and bills of material by scanning a barcode with a mobile device.

In this release, we've enhanced Advanced Kit Assembly so you can specify substitute component items.

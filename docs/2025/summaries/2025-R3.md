# 2025 R3 Executive Summary

**Bottom Line Up Front:** R3 2025 is a significant release for AP and Purchasing teams, with embedded vendor payments (MineralTree) going GA in the US, expanded AP Automation capabilities, and a new multi-document-to-single-transaction workflow in Purchasing now available to all regions. Finance leaders should act immediately on the required email domain authentication and plan for the retirement of Authorize.net/PayPal payment integrations by November 2025.

## Breaking Changes & Deprecations

- **Authorize.net and PayPal integrations retiring November 7, 2025** — migrate to Versapay or another solution to continue accepting customer payments (US only).
- **Enhanced lists becoming the default UI** across all regions — teams should familiarize themselves with the new list experience before it switches over.
- **Warehouse transfer transaction definitions are replacing Inventory transfer transaction definitions**, affecting inventory tracking workflows (AU, CA, ZA, UK, US).

## Action Required

- **Authenticate and validate your email domain now** to ensure outbound emails (invoices, statements) continue to deliver reliably to customers and partners (all regions).
- **Plan migration off Authorize.net/PayPal** before the November 7, 2025 retirement date (US only).
- **Review permission changes** for Sage Intelligent Time, Accounts Receivable, Contracts, and Order Entry modules to ensure user access remains correct (all regions).

## New Capabilities (GA)

- **Vendor Payments powered by MineralTree** — embedded bill payment directly within Sage Intacct, working with your existing AP process (US only).
- **Combine multiple Purchasing documents into a single transaction**, including selecting individual lines across documents (all regions).
- **Automated Purchasing transactions without matching** — vendor invoices that don't match to POs or requisitions can now be processed automatically via AP Automation (all regions).
- **Customer refunds** — record refunds against existing customer credits directly in AR (all regions).
- **Close Automation suite** — tools for a smoother, faster period-end close (UK, US).

## AI & Automation

- **Sage Copilot AI-powered help search** understands context and intent behind queries for more relevant results (English-speaking regions).
- **Smarter AP Automation email processing** — auto-forwarding rules, inline attachment extraction, and transaction data capture from email bodies (all regions).
- **AP Automation supports ZUGFeRD e-invoice format** for incoming German bills (Germany).
- **AI-powered import service updates** — simplified data imports with AI-driven field mapping across multiple modules (all regions).

## Early Adopter Opportunities

- **Sage Copilot Close Workspace** — standardized, repeatable close checklists with trackable workflows (UK, US).
- **Line-level matching for AP Automation with Purchasing** — more precise document matching at the line level (all regions).
- **Equity method for Advanced Ownership Consolidation** — automatic equity entries with multi-parent/multi-level rollup support (AU, CA, ZA, UK, US).
- **Employee leave management in Sage Intelligent Time** — leave requests, approvals, and balance tracking within timesheets (US only).
- **WIP management at preferred cost detail level** for Construction projects (AU, CA, ZA, UK, US).

## Platform & API Changes

- **REST API continues as the primary integration path** — all new objects and features will be released in REST API only; XML API is in maintenance mode.
- **Configuration objects (Early Adopter)** — define key-value pairs in structured files, referenceable anywhere merge fields are supported (all regions).
- **New custom report objects** for AP Payment Approval History and AR Customer Refunds (all regions).

## Minor Enhancements

- **Delegate bill approvals** when approvers are out-of-office, keeping AP workflows moving (all regions).
- **Summarize OE revenue recognition entries** daily, weekly, or monthly to reduce GL transaction volume and speed up reconciliation (AU, CA, ZA, UK, US).
- **Fixed Assets bulk operations** — bulk-update assets via import service, revert posted depreciation entries in bulk, and view cumulative depreciation (all regions).
- **Customizable timesheet entry grid and automatic overtime calculation** in Sage Intelligent Time (AU, CA, ZA, UK, US; overtime US only).
- **Link credit card transactions and e-receipts to expense reports** for faster, more automated expense processing (US only).

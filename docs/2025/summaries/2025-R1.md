# 2025 R1 Executive Summary

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Sage Intacct 2025-R1 brings AP Automation with Purchasing to general availability across all regions, introduces the REST API as GA for integrations, and requires all customers to authenticate custom email domains before May 2025 to maintain email delivery. The Authorize.net and PayPal payment integrations are being retired on November 7, 2025, so AR teams accepting customer payments need to plan a migration to Versapay.

## Breaking Changes & Deprecations

- **Authorize.net and PayPal integrations retiring November 7, 2025** — companies using these for customer payment processing must migrate to Versapay or another solution.
- Updated database field names for WIP management may affect custom reports or integrations referencing old field names (AU, CA, US).
- Permission menu changes across all regions — review updated permission structures to ensure user access remains correct.

## Action Required

- **Authenticate and validate your custom email domain before May 2025** to ensure outbound emails from Sage Intacct continue to be delivered reliably (all regions).
- **Canadian companies: Install updated standard tax solution** to reflect Nova Scotia's April 2025 HST rate decrease before that effective date.
- Begin planning migration off Authorize.net/PayPal integrations well ahead of the November 2025 cutoff.

## AI & Automation

# 2025 R2 Executive Summary

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Sage Intacct 2025-R2 delivers meaningful improvements to month-end close workflows, inter-entity accounting, and fixed assets management. The most urgent action item is authenticating your custom email domain by end of May 2025 to avoid email delivery disruptions. Additionally, Authorize.net and PayPal payment integrations are being retired November 7, 2025 (US only), requiring migration to Versapay.

## Breaking Changes & Deprecations

- **Authorize.net and PayPal integrations retiring November 7, 2025** — migrate to Versapay to continue accepting customer payments in Sage Intacct (US only).
- **Classic bank transaction import for reconciliation is retiring** — use the Bank Transaction Assistant file import instead.
- **Special characters now restricted** in certain AP and AR fields, which may affect existing integrations or data entry workflows.
- **Post permissions now required** when importing non-draft AP adjustments and AR invoices/adjustments — review user roles accordingly.
- **Time and Expenses split into two separate applications** with dedicated menus; subscription still includes both.

## Action Required

- **Authenticate and validate your custom email domain during May 2025** to ensure outbound emails from Sage Intacct continue to deliver reliably.
- **Plan migration from Authorize.net/PayPal** to Versapay before the November 7, 2025 retirement date (US only).
- **Review permission changes** across AP, AR, Expenses, Projects, and Time modules to ensure users retain appropriate access.
- **Transition to Bank Transaction Assistant** for credit card and bank transaction imports before the classic import experience is removed.

## New Capabilities (GA)

- **Affiliate entity dimension (GA)** — new standard dimension automatically tags inter-entity activity for more granular elimination entries in consolidations.
- **Transfer assets between entities** in Fixed Assets Management with accurate accounting treatment, plus revert capability and a new Depreciation Roll Forward report.
- **REST API Bulk Request Service (GA)** — process large data volumes more efficiently through the REST API.
- **New AI-powered import service (GA)** — simplifies data imports by automatically handling field mapping and complexity.
- **Sage Intacct Fundraising powered by DonorPerfect (GA)** — integrated donor management and fundraising campaign tools (Canada, US).

## AI & Automation

- **Copilot Subledger Reconciliation Assistant (Early Adopter)** — automates AP/AR reconciliations with real-time variance detection and drill-down insights for faster month-end close (UK, US).
- **Employee expense automation mobile app (Early Adopter)** — AI-powered receipt capture, expense submission, and approval from mobile devices (US only).
- **AP Automation for non-matching Purchasing transactions (Early Adopter)** — auto-creates transactions for vendor invoices that don't match POs or requisitions, with intelligent predictions that improve over time.
- **AP Automation now supports the Project dimension** and companies using Advanced Audit Trail (US only).

## Early Adopter Opportunities

- **GST support for New Zealand** — standard tax solution and tax submission workflow (Australia/NZ).
- **GST support for Singapore** — standard tax solution and tax submission workflow (Australia/Singapore).
- **Platform event queue trigger** — flexible event management retrieval lets integrations poll for notifications on their own schedule.

## Platform & API Changes

- **Webhook delivery option for Platform triggers (GA)** — simplifies HTTP POST requests in trigger configurations.
- **Event queue trigger (Early Adopter)** — enables pull-based event retrieval for more flexible integration patterns.
- **REST API is now the primary development path** — all new objects and features will be released in REST API only; XML API remains supported but frozen.
- **ICRW Reload Server Metadata** — immediately surface new custom fields and user-defined dimensions in Interactive Custom Report Writer without waiting.

## Minor Enhancements

- **Automated WIP relief** — automatically reclassifies work-in-progress balances upon project completion to accelerate close (AU, CA, ZA, UK, US).
- **Contracts summary tab** — consolidated view of OE, AR, Purchasing, AP transactions and project insights per contract (AU, CA, ZA, UK, US).
- **300+ new enhanced lists** with side-by-side record details, advanced filters, and customizable views.

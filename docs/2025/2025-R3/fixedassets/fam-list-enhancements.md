Fixed Assets Management

We added new features to Fixed Assets Management lists and pages, making it easier to manage journal posting rules, navigate to depreciation schedules, and more.

## Manage journal posting rules more easily

We added the ability to add, edit, and remove journal posting rules directly from the edit page of Fixed Assets Management configuration. Previously, to manage journal posting rules you had to save the configuration first, adding extra steps. Now, you can update journal posting rules alongside configuration settings, streamlining your workflow and improving efficiency.

## Easier navigation for viewing depreciation schedules

On the Depreciation schedules tab of an asset, you can now select a schedule's ID to drill down and view its details. Previously, you had to scroll to the end of the row and select **More actions** > **View**.

## Improved placement of the Allocation field

![Dimensions section showing the Allocation field.](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/Resources/Images/2025/2025-R3-images/2025-R3-fam-allocation-field.png)

To improve usability and consistency, the **Allocation** field now appears alongside other dimensions on the following pages:

- Create, Edit, and View Asset
- Transfer Asset
- View Transfer

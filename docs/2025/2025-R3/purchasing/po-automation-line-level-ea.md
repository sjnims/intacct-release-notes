# Line-level matching for smarter Purchasing automation—Early Adopter

[Compare header-level to line-level transaction matching](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Automated_txn_line_level_vs_header_level_matching)

[Turn on line-level transaction matching](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Turn_on_line_level_matching)

Purchasing

Line-level matching introduces a more precise way to automate transaction processing with AP Automation with Purchasing. Instead of relying on source transaction data, this feature uses AI/ML to match and populate line items directly from vendor documents that you email or upload. This enhancement helps reduce manual corrections and improves automated transaction draft accuracy.

## Key benefits

Line-level matching increases the accuracy of transaction data by using the vendor document as the source of truth. It flags discrepancies in quantity or price, allowing you to quickly identify and resolve mismatches. This reduces the time spent on manual edits and improves confidence in automated transaction processing.

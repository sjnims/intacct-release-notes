# Improvements to value transformations in EMRConnect

EMRConnect works with most delimited flat files that are exported from EMR (electronic medical records) systems. You can set up field mappings for as many formats as you need.

In this release, we've added a Value Transformations page that helps you make value transformations more quickly and easily.

## Key benefits

- Select multiple value transformations at a time.
- Find value transformations more easily with improved search functionality.
- Sort value transformations by file type.
- Value transformations without a file type are associated with **No Group**.

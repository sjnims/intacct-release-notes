[Process customer payments using Bank transaction assistant](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Receive_bulk_payments_bank_txns)

cash management

For greater flexibility, you can now draft customer payments that you're not ready to post using Bank transaction assistant.

You can also post draft payments in bulk from the Posted payments page in Accounts Receivable. If you decide you no longer need a draft, you can simply delete it from the list.

## How it works

1. Go to **Cash Management** > **All** > **Bank transactions**.
2. Select the **Cash in** view.
3. Select a transaction and select **Assign to customer**.
4. Assign the transaction to a customer record.
5. Select the transaction and select **Receive payments**.
6. Select **Create draft payments**.

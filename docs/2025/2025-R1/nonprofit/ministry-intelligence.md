# Enhancements in Sage Intacct Ministry Intelligence

[About Sage Intacct Ministry Intelligence](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=ministry_intelligence)

NONPROFIT

Ministry Intelligence seamlessly connects accounting and business operations by delivering key church management data and visibility into KPIs and insights critical to strengthening congregation health.

We've recently made Ministry Intelligence even better with the following enhancements:

- **Specify start and end dates for syncing with Sage Intacct:** Specifying these dates can be useful if you do not want to sync entries for the current month before the previous month-end processes are completed.
- **Customize giver lapse timing:** Define the number of days that determines a lapsed giver.
- **Track soft credit givers:** If you use Ministry Platform or TouchPoint as your ChMS and sync your transactions to Sage Intacct, you can post and attribute gifts to the soft credit donor tagged on the transaction.

  For example, suppose that a donor directs a gift to your church through an IRA. The brokerage account is the IRS giver (the hard giver), but the new feature also tracks the donor who directed the gift (the soft giver).

- **Post Other Receipts in summary:** You no longer need to post Other Receipts in detail. You can now also post them in summary, and data from the transactions will appear in the Ministry Intelligence dashboards.
- **Import attendance entries and post them as statistical entries:** As with importing transactions, the import map for these amounts can be customized to fit the format of reports from your attendance-tracking system.
- **Map funds by Location or Department:** In addition to Class, Project, and user-defined dimensions, you can now select Location and Department as the fund mapping dimension for analyzing sustaining giving.

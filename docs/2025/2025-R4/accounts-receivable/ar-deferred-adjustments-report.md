# Deferred adjustments forecast report enhancements—France

We've improved the deferred adjustments forecast report for Charges constatées d’avance (CCA) in Accounts Receivable, giving you greater visibility into adjustment periods so you can review timelines and make informed decisions.

Now, you can view the **Deferred adjustments start date** and **Deferred adjustments end date** fields when running the report in Detail mode.

Consoles

Previously, when creating a new instance using the Instance Setup Wizard, you used the Subscribe tab to add applications to the instance. Now, you subscribe to applications directly from within the company after you create it.

## How it works

[Step 1. Create an instance company](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2025/2025_Release_4/Company_and_Administration/2025-R4-subscribe-tab-removed-from-setup-wizard.htm#)

1. Go to **My practice** or **Console** > **All** and select Add (circle) sign next to **Instances**.
2. Complete the fields on each tab.
   - When you complete the fields on a tab, select **Next** or select the next tab in the header sequence.
   - To change fields on a tab that you completed, select **Previous** or select the tab in the header sequence.

3. After you complete the tabs, select **Done**.

   Your new instance appears on the Instances page.

[Step 2. After the company is created, slide into the instance](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2025/2025_Release_4/Company_and_Administration/2025-R4-subscribe-tab-removed-from-setup-wizard.htm#)

1. Go to **My instances** > **All** > **Instances** > **My instances**.
2. Find the instance and select **Switch to <company name>**.

   Intacct launches the instance in a new browser tab.

   If you receive an error message indicating that you cannot access the selected instance, contact your Intacct administrator.

   Your console is still open in its original browser tab. You can return to the console anytime by selecting the tab.

[Step 3. Subscribe to applications from within the company](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2025/2025_Release_4/Company_and_Administration/2025-R4-subscribe-tab-removed-from-setup-wizard.htm#)

1. Go to **Company** > **Admin** > **Subscriptions**.
2. On the Applications tab, select the application icon or toggle.
3. Select **Subscribe**.
4. On the configuration page, enter the required information and enable options.
5. Select **Save**.

## Good to know

Each client or entity is an instance of Sage Intacct. A console is a Sage Intacct interface used by accountants, partners, and certain multi-entity companies to set up, modify, or access instances. Consoles users slide in from the console to access an instance. In each instance, console users are identified as external users that can perform accounting and implementation tasks.

# Sage Intacct Construction Payroll

Sage Intacct Construction Payroll handles construction payroll complexities not found in general payroll solutions. This solution provides a complete view of your project costs with unprecedented visibility into each cost component.

For more information, talk to your [Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

We're excited to share the latest features added in Sage Intacct Construction Payroll. The improvements include the following enhancements.

Create a free account to log in and review the Construction Payroll Help Center.

- The Sage Intacct Construction Payroll Pay Stub Access Portal is now available to all users! Review the articles within the [Employee Pay Stub Access section in the Help Center](https://help.cloudpayrollengine.com/hc/en-us/sections/18501915089047-Employee-Pay-Stub-Access) to learn how to leverage the new feature.
- Users can now select Regenerate Pay Stubs within the Actions field. More details on this process are available in the [Reprint Payroll Checks article](https://help.cloudpayrollengine.com/hc/en-us/articles/12720055694103-Reprint-Payroll-Checks).
- All checks are sent to Time & Expense for payment as reimbursements. This eliminates the need to add journal entries manually for printed checks. To learn more, see the [Check Payment Process article](https://help.cloudpayrollengine.com/hc/en-us/articles/18943987716887-Check-Payment-Process).
- You can now change the default classification-based tax hierarchy in Entity configuration. This allows the Workers Compensation code on the job/costcode override to supersede the code entered on the employee profile. For more information, see [Workers Compensation/General Liability Hierarchy](https://help.cloudpayrollengine.com/hc/en-us/articles/12138040746263).
- Reporting data now seamlessly synchronizes with Sage Intacct Interactive Custom Report Writer (ICRW) whenever a check is updated. This eliminates the need to select Send Reporting Data and wait for data synchronization.
- We've made updates to boost application performance and user-friendliness, resulting in a notable reduction of payroll processing times by as much as 50%.

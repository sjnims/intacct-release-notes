# AP and AR aging reports enhanced to display retainage balances

This idea came from you!

You spoke and we listened! We enhanced the AP and AR aging standard reports so that now they reflect the retainage balance as of the **Date to use** that you select.

Previously, if you set the **Date to use** field for an AP or AR aging standard report, the report displayed the retainage balance for the current day's date. Now, when you set the **Date to use** field, the report displays the retainage balance as of the set date.

## Example

Before, if you released retainage in January, and then ran an aging standard report with the **Date to use** set as December 31, the report showed the retainage balance for the current day's date.

Now, if you release retainage in January, and then run an aging standard report with the **Date to use** set as December 31, the report shows the retainage balance as of December 31.

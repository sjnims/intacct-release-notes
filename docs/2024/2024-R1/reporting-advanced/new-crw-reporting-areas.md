# New Custom Report Writer reporting areas

Custom Report Writer (CRW) offers the following new reporting areas:

- A new **Cash Management (CM) Reconciliation Match** reporting area that area enables you to create reports of bank reconciliation matches with CRW. For more information, see [Create a reconciliation match sequence report](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2024/2024_Release_1/Cash_Management/2024-R1-match-sequence-report.htm).
- A new **Advanced Ownership Consolidation (AOC)** reporting area enables you to run detailed reports generated by consolidation entries. For more information, see [Create custom consolidation reports for Advanced Ownership Consolidation](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2024/2024_Release_1/Consolidation/2024-R1-AOC-custom-report.htm).

## How it works

One of the first things you do when you create a CRW is to select a reporting area, or data source. A reporting area correlates with data objects. Each reporting area provides specialized data options that you can choose to include in your report or visualization.

For detailed instructions, see [selecting a data source with the Custom Report Writer](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Choose_the_data_type_for_your).

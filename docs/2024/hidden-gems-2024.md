### Limit contacts available in transaction dropdowns

Streamline processing Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable transactions by limiting selectable contacts in dropdowns. To help prevent data entry errors, you can restrict contact options to only those associated with a vendor record, or the specific vendor selected for the transaction.

[Streamline your work with limited contacts](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2024/2024_Release_1/Accounts_Payable/2024-R1-ap-restrict-contacts.htm?utm_source=2024-hiddengems&utm_campaign=2024-hiddengems-limit-contacts)

### Edit tax information in draft bills

Companies using Taxes can now edit tax information for bills in a draft state. Users can now save progress and refine tax details before posting the bill. Intacct ensures accuracy by validating tax information only upon bill posting.

We've made it easier to track how purchase document workflows are processed by showing which document started each transaction. Better tracking helps with inventory reconciliation, which leads to better overall inventory management.

### Version history for financial reports

Version history for financial reports allows you to track changes made to report settings over time. By comparing current and previous versions, users can easily identify and troubleshoot unexpected results, revert to previous working versions, and maintain the integrity of their financial reporting.

COMPANY AND Administration

We're excited to announce the launch of Usage insights, a new tool designed to empower you with real-time data and actionable insights to optimize your company's operations.

Usage insights unifies visibility across your company. Information is consolidated real-time from multiple sources, providing a comprehensive view of your entire operation. This gives you operational intelligence to make confident choices. Insights previously hidden in your data come to the surface, allowing you to optimize processes and achieve better outcomes.

You can also go beyond basic reporting. Usage insights delivers deep dives into key areas like transaction volume, usage patterns, access and permissions, and more. This information empowers you to take proactive steps with your business.

## Details

Usage insights provides pre-built views of metrics to facilitate operational decision-making about your accounting processes.

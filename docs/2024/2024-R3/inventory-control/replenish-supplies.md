INVENTORY CONTROL

The Supplies workbench, introduced in 2024 R2, provides a convenient way to manage employee requests for supplies inventory items. In R3, we're expanding the functionality, adding Replenishment capabilities. The supplies manager can now generate a report on all incoming supplies requests, evaluate reorder needs, and quickly replenish most-needed items.

## Details

A supplies manager can review incoming requests in the Supplies workbench to continuously meet the demand for employee supplies requests:

- Generate a report on most-needed items.
- Sort requests by item to conveniently order similar items from the same vendor.
- Issue items directly from available inventory.
- Create a purchase order if an item is not available internally.
- Create a direct shipment purchase from a preferred vendor to the employee.

## How it works

### Replenish supplies inventory

This is a brief overview of the replenishment process. For more details on all Supplies workbench functions, see [About the Supplies Workbench.](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=supplies-workbench)

1. Go to **Inventory Control** or **Purchasing** \> **All** \> **Supplies inventory** > **Workbench**.

   The table grid breaks out the requisitions as individual line items.

2. Select requisitions that are ready to order.
3. Select  **More (...) > Replenishment** .
4. In the Replenish inventory window, review the list of requests and choose orders for replenishment.
5. Select **Apply** to generate the replenishment list of orders. You 'll then verify order details before generating required purchase orders. For more details see [Replenish inventory.](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Replenish_inventory)

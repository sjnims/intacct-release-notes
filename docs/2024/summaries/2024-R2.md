# 2024 R2 Executive Summary

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Sage Intacct 2024-R2 delivers a new REST API in open beta, AI-powered AP automation predictions for all AP Automation customers, and general availability of Sage Intelligent Time and the bank transaction assistant. This release also introduces significant capabilities for construction (WIP management), fixed assets (auto-creation from purchasing), and France-based companies (full domestic VAT support). Finance leaders should evaluate the early adopter programs for automated transaction matching and supplies inventory, and note that Gantt charts in Projects are being retired.

## Breaking Changes & Deprecations

- **Gantt charts retiring in Projects (PSA):** Sage Intacct is retiring Gantt charts; users should transition to resource plan reporting instead.
- **Expense schedule posting date validation:** A new validation now requires scheduled expense posting dates to be on or after the expense template start date, which may reject previously accepted configurations.
- **Memo reclassification behavior change:** Reclassifying the memo on a bill now affects the corresponding payment memo—review workflows that depend on memo consistency.
- **Restricted user permission changes:** Updated restrictions on what limited-access users can do in both Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable; review affected roles.

## Action Required

- **New AR permissions added:** Review and assign new Accounts Receivable permissions to ensure users retain appropriate access.
- **Passwordless authentication via Microsoft Entra:** Now supported—coordinate with IT to evaluate rollout and retire password-based sign-in where appropriate.
- **Designated support users (limit of 2):** Sage now provides exactly 2 designated support contacts per company; confirm the right people are assigned.
- **Consolidation: Separated opening balance entries:** Opening balances are now separated from current-period activity after the first period—validate consolidation reports for any presentation changes.

## New Capabilities (GA)

- **Sage Intelligent Time (GA):** AI-powered time capture embedded in Intacct is now generally available, including redesigned approvals, timesheet recall, and audit trail visibility.
- **Bank transaction assistant file import (GA):** Guided bank data import now supports OFX and QIF files for faster, more controlled bank transaction ingestion.
- **PwC Control Insights (GA):** Proactive internal controls assessment tool with prioritized, actionable recommendations is now generally available.
- **Fixed Assets Management with purchasing integration:** New application automates asset lifecycle from acquisition to disposal, including automatic asset creation from vendor invoices.
- **Blanket Purchase/Sales Orders by price:** Track non-inventoried services and approved spending amounts drawn down over time using price-based conversion on blanket orders.

## AI & Automation

- **AP Automation AI predictions (all customers):** All AP Automation customers now get AI-predicted GL account and select dimension coding on incoming bills.
- **AI-generated time entry descriptions (beta):** Sage Intelligent Time can now auto-generate time entry descriptions using an AI assistant.
- **Automated transaction matching (early adopter):** Sage Intacct can auto-create vendor invoices and match them to existing purchasing transactions, reducing manual AP effort.

## Early Adopter Opportunities

- **Sage Intacct Fundraising powered by DonorPerfect (Nonprofits):** Donor management and fundraising campaign execution with integrated dashboards and reporting.
- **Work-in-Progress (WIP) management (Construction):** Interactive WIP schedules to track overbilling, underbilling, and projected profits at the project level.
- **Supplies inventory:** End-to-end workflow for requesting, fulfilling, and accounting for stocked consumable supplies.
- **Credit card transaction import for reconciliation:** Use classic file import to reconcile credit card accounts in Cash Management.

## Platform & API Changes

- **REST API (open beta):** New REST API focused on ease-of-use and stability is now available for developer evaluation and integration planning.
- **Configurable lists (beta):** New personalization and drill-down capabilities in list views across the application.
- **Smart event logging improvement:** Smart events no longer require a separate package installation; logging is now built in.
- **Customization package enhancements:** Platform applications can now selectively exclude components from packages for cleaner deployments.
- **Construction DDS support:** Construction module now supports Data Delivery Service (DDS) objects for data extraction and analytics.

## Minor Enhancements

- **French VAT and FEC reporting (France):** Full domestic TVA Française tax solution with cash-basis VAT capture and FEC export for compliance. Partial exemption support also added (UK, France).
- **Canadian bank file payments and T5018:** Electronic vendor/employee payments in CAD and T5018 XML generation for CRA filing (Canada).
- **Employee expense allocations:** Expense reports now support transaction allocations for faster, more accurate coding of receipts.
- **Draft AR payments:** Received payments can now be saved as drafts before posting, adding flexibility to cash application workflows.
- **Fiscal year rollover for document sequences:** Document sequences now handle year-end transitions automatically.

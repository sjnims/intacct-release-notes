# 2024 R1 Executive Summary

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Sage Intacct 2024-R1 focuses on breaking down data silos with two new integration products (Data Flow and Forms & Operational Workflows), expanding AI-driven AP automation to line-level GL coding, and introducing automated PO-to-invoice matching in Early Adopter. Construction subscribers gain significant compliance and billing visibility improvements, and several security and self-service account recovery enhancements are now live.

## Action Required

- **New user account email for security:** Set up the new account email address now to enable faster lockout resolution and self-service account recovery.
- **Permission changes across multiple modules:** Review updated and new permissions for Contracts (separate Cancel/Uncancel), Interactive Custom Report Writer (new Primary Consumer role), Order Entry, Projects, and Time & Expenses (unmask bank details).
- **Smart event log changes coming soon:** A forthcoming change to how Smart events are logged will eliminate the need for a separate package installation—plan accordingly.
- **Restricted user access tightened:** Restricted users can no longer reverse bills (AP) or invoices meeting certain criteria (AR)—verify this doesn't disrupt current workflows.

## New Capabilities (GA)

- **Sage Intacct Data Flow** automates scheduled, secure data transfers between operational systems and Sage Intacct to eliminate siloed data.
- **Sage Intacct Forms and Operational Workflows** digitizes data collection and organizational workflows directly within the platform.
- **Alpha sequences for reconciliation matching** are now generally available for bank reconciliation.
- **Financial report version history** lets you review and restore previous versions of financial reports when changes cause issues.
- **Commitment compliance on primary documents** (Construction) enables adding, editing, and deleting compliance records directly from purchase orders and subcontracts.

## AI & Automation

- **AP Automation multi-line GL coding (Early Adopter):** AI/ML now predicts GL account and dimension codes at the individual line level, expanding beyond header-level coding.
- **PO line-level matching (Early Adopter):** Sage Intacct can auto-create vendor invoices and match them to purchasing transactions by quantity and price.
- **Sage Intacct Professional Services Automation powered by Forecast:** AI-powered project resource management for services firms, with win/loss learning.
- **Sage Intelligent Time enhancements:** Print functionality for timesheets, improved filtering/sorting, Construction dimensions, and upgraded smart time entry.

## Early Adopter Opportunities

- **Line-level GL account and dimension coding** for AP Automation—expanded AI model worth evaluating if you process high-volume AP.
- **Automated transaction matching for Purchasing workflows**—expanded Early Adopter program for PO-to-invoice matching automation.

## Platform & API Changes

- **API usage dashboard now available for consoles**, giving multi-company environments a centralized view of API consumption across all entities.
- **Platform custom help** allows administrators to add context-specific custom help content within Sage Intacct for end users.
- **New Custom Report Writer (CRW) reporting areas** for bank reconciliation match reports and Advanced Ownership Consolidation detail reports.
- **New ICRW Primary Consumer role** provides view-and-run access to reports outside a user's normal permissions without granting full admin rights.

## Minor Enhancements

- **Bank transaction dating** lets you set a time zone per bank account to control how bank feed transactions are dated.
- **Contact list filtering** in AP (Pay to/Return to) and AR (Bill to/Ship to) simplifies transaction entry by limiting displayed contacts.
- **AP approval notifications for submitters:** Users who submit bills or purchasing transactions now receive email notifications on approval or decline.
- **Contracts:** MEA price lists can now be imported via CSV templates, and kit billing support expanded to all Flat/fixed frequency options.
- **GL revaluation reports** can now run in summary format, and Consolidation users can drill down to single-currency source transactions for improved audit traceability.

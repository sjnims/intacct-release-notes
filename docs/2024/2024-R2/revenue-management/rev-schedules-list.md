# New Revenue recognition schedules list

This idea came from you

Introducing the new **Revenue recognition schedules** list! Use this list to easily find and maintain your revenue recognition schedules. From this list, you can edit or view a revenue recognition schedule or export a selected list view.

The **Revenue recognition schedules** list is also an enhanced list, giving you the power to use advanced filters, personalize your list view, and view list and record details side-by-side.

## What's new

We added new user interface elements to expand the usability of revenue recognition schedules.

### Revenue recognition schedules menu option

We added a new **Revenue recognition** heading to the **Order Entry > **All tab\***\*. Use the new **Revenue schedules** menu option to access the new**Revenue recognition schedules\*\* list.

### Revenue recognition schedules list

The new Revenue recognition schedules list uses Sage Intacct's enhanced beta list framework. This framework gives you the flexibility to add or remove columns from the view and to resize and freeze columns.

You can also view the list and schedule details side-by-side. You can view, edit, hold, or terminate revenue recognition schedules in the split view.

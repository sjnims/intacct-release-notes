# Inventory inquiry for kit components

Replacing a kit component can be a challenge if an item is used in several kits. With the new kit component item inquiry report you can easily find all the kits where specific items are included. After the kits are identified, you can make your required adjustments.

## Details

Perform a kit component item inquiry to:

- Identify kits that include a specific component item.
- Adjust component item details for impacted kits.

## How it works

1. Go to **Inventory Control** > **Setup** > **Inventory utilities**.
2. On the GL subledger reconciliation tab, add the Item ID filter.
3. Download the **Component Item Where Used Report**.

## Management fee updates

You can now tag management companies with a customer entity so that the system can create a corporate accounts receivable record for management fee transactions.

To create the corresponding corporate accounts receivable record when a management fee is billed to a company, use the new Customer and Item ID fields. These fields are in the Accounting section on the Edit Property page.

Select the customer and item ID to use for the corporate accounting customer and the revenue account to use for the management fee.

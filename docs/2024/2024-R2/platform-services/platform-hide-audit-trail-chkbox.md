# Audit Trail checkbox for system-generated object fields removed

To improve usability, we removed the Audit Trail checkbox for system-generated object fields.

## Details

We updated the edit page for object fields that are system-generated. The option to check **Track changes to this field in each record's Audit Trail for a complete historical log** no longer exists.

This option still appears on object field pages for objects that are not system-generated.

Budgeting and Planning

Sage Intacct Planning (SIP) is an add-on application that offers a collaborative environment for preparing and managing budgets.

If you have not subscribed to Sage Intacct Planning, talk to your Sage Intacct account manager for information about [subscribing](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

## Sync accounts wizard

In Sage Intacct, you can modify the IDs and names of existing accounts, which can create differences with the accounts that appear in Sage Intacct Planning.

To ensure that data presented in Planning accurately matches Sage Intacct, run the Sync accounts with Sage Intacct wizard.

The changes that you make in the wizard update everything associated with the updated accounts and are reflected throughout Sage Intacct Planning, including:

- Dashboard, Sheets, Inputs, and Actuals tabs
- Versions and scenarios
- Shared budgets
- Statistical accounts and models

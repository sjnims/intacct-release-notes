# Introducing Copilot Variance Analysis—Early Adopter

Copilot Variance Analysis provides insights into budget or prior period differences so business leaders can proactively investigate discrepancies and address spending concerns. Copilot notifications are designed to keep budget owners in the loop, whether it’s a timely update or an on-demand review. You can drill into report insights to see exactly how your budget is doing, including detailed breakdowns and visualizations.

We're delighted to share that additional Copilot features are in development and will be added in future releases. We're offering a limited number of users the chance to be pioneers in the next generation of technology by joining the Early Adopter program.

## Details

Copilot Variance Analysis includes the following:

- **Automated alerts**: Receive notifications when actual expenses exceed budget, allowing for immediate action.
- **Real-time variance tracking**: Monitor budget vs. actual variances in real-time, ensuring you're always aware of your financial health.
- **Data visualization**: Visualize your financial data through intuitive charts and graphs for easy understanding.
- **Drill-down analysis**: Easily drill down into reports to identify the root causes of variances for specific GL accounts.
- **Detailed variance insights**: Get AI-generated variance descriptions that identify potential causes and implications of the variances.

## What's the Early Adopter program?

The Early Adopter program allows a select group of customers to test and provide feedback on new features. Their input will help us refine and improve these features before the general release.

The Early Adopter program is actively monitored. We work closely with the early adopters to ensure that we focus our time and attention on what matters most to you.

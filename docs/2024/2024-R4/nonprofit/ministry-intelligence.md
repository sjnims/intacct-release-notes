# Enhancements in Sage Intacct Ministry Intelligence

[About Sage Intacct Ministry Intelligence](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=ministry_intelligence)

NONPROFIT

Ministry Intelligence seamlessly connects accounting and business operations by delivering key church management data and visibility into KPIs and insights critical to strengthening congregation health.

We've recently made Ministry Intelligence even better with the following enhancements.

- New configuration options give you more control to set up Ministry Intelligence to meet your needs.
- Importing transactions through up-to-date dashboards is now easier.

  Also, you can now import transactions even if your ChMS does not include a Transaction ID on the exported giving report. Ministry Intelligence can now use three fields to create a unique transaction identifier to ensure that no duplicate transactions are imported.

For more information about Ministry Intelligence, talk to your [Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

ADVANCED REPORTING

The new ICRW Narrative view allows you to add text to report results to provide enhanced context, analysis highlights, or in-depth descriptions.

ICRW requires a separate subscription. For information on attaining an ICRW subscription, [contact your Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

## Details

The new ICRW Narrative view allows you to include text and an analysis of column values in a report within a separate view. Queries you provide control the number of row values that appear in the Narrative view. By default, all queried rows are displayed.

An excellent use for the Narrative View is as an alternative to the Title View. You can include HTML markup for emphasis in the Narrative View, where HTML is not allowed in the Title View.

For detailed instructions on how you can use this new feature, see [Add Narrative views to ICRW reports](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=ICRW-add-narrative-views).

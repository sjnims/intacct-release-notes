# Track project change orders and change requests assigned to a project or project contract

From a project or project contract, you can view or export project change orders and change requests assigned to the project or project contract. We've added a new **Change management** tab on the Project information page and the Project contracts page, enabling you to track project change orders and change requests from a project or project contract easily.

## Details

When project change orders and change requests are assigned to a project or project contract, they automatically appear on the **Change management** tab for that specific project or project contract.

### About project change orders

A project change order summarizes the total price and costs of multiple change requests. This simplifies the billing process for multiple change requests in a single project. Project change orders streamline your ability to monitor project changes and bill customers.

When you create a project change order, you assign it to a project. You can also assign the project change order to a project contract. Then, the project change order appears on the **Change management** tab for the project and project contract.

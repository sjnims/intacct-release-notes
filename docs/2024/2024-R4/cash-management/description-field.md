Starting on November 18, 2024, the Description field on some bank connections provided by Plaid will be changing. We are enhancing the accuracy of this field to better align with the descriptions on your bank statement.

Because of this change, you may need to [adjust your matching and creation rules](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Update_matching_rule) to ensure they continue to work correctly.

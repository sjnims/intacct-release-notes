Our new tax submission workflow streamlines the tax filing process for any company using a custom tax solution. When you create a tax submission, you can track transactions that are included for a selected period and then run reports to extract the data needed for filing. After you complete your manual submission, you can mark the submitted transactions as filed.

Join our Early Adopter program to get early access to this feature.

## What is the Early adopter program?

The Early adopter program provides the new Tax submission for custom tax solutions to users subscribed to the Taxes application. As an early adopter, you can influence how we develop the product so that our product meets your business needs.

The Early adopter program participants work closely with Sage Intacct product managers to ensure we focus on what matters most. Early adopter participants are expected to respond periodically to surveys and provide input.

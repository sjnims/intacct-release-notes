Accsspay now supports even more bank feed connections. If your bank uses BAI2 files and transmits them via an SFTP connection, AccessPay can now process that data. Expand your coverage and make reconciling a snap with premium bank feed connections.

There is a fee to use the AccessPay service. This fee is determined by AccessPay. Most banks also charge a fee when sending files to Sage Intacct. Sage Intacct has no control over these fees and does not charge for the first 200 connections.

## Details

AccessPay is a fully automated statement retrieval service. AccessPay delivers reliable and detailed statement information from MT-940 and BAI2 files provided by your bank directly into Sage Intacct via the SWIFT network and SFTP. Check with AccessPay to determine if your bank and account is supported.

## How it works

To get started, [contact AccessPay](https://identity.accesspay.com/sage) and request a connection between your bank and Sage Intacct. You'll be working directly with them during the connection process. After an established connection has been determined, you can connect to a bank feed within Sage Intacct.

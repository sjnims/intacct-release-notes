# Enhanced currency support for funds transfers—Early adopter

[Funds transfers](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=HOTP_Funds_transfer_EA)

cash management

Global companies can now process funds transfers with up to 3 unique currencies without having to create a manual journal entry.

## Details

We streamlined the process of creating a funds transfer and made it easy to work with 3 currencies.

- When creating a funds transfer, just enter the amount sent and the amount received; you do not need to add an exchange rate.
- Based on what you enter, we select the most accurate exchange rate.
- When required, we automatically create a rounding entry to account for any exchange rate differences.

## How it works

1. Go to **Cash Management** > **All** > **Transactions** > **Funds transfer**.
2. Select the source **From account**.

   The Balance and Currency of the account appear for reference.

3. Enter the **Transfer amount** in the transaction currency.
4. Enter the **Transfer date**.
5. Select the destination **To account**.

   The Balance and Currency of the account appear for reference.

6. Enter the **Amount received**.
7. Select **Save**.

## What is the Early adopter program?

The Early adopter program provides the new funds transfer to users of the Cash Management application. As an early adopter, you can influence how we develop the product so that our product meets your business needs.

The Early adopter program participants work closely with Sage Intacct product managers to ensure we focus on what matters most. Early adopter participants are expected to periodically respond to surveys and provide input.

# Search help with Copilot—Phased General Availability

Following the great feedback we received from our early adopters, we're excited to announce the phased rollout for Search help with Copilot. Our new semantic search engine is designed to revolutionize the way you find help and answers within Sage Intacct.

Customers and partners have already been selected for the first phase of the rollout occurring during R1. We look forward to welcoming more customers as we expand the rollout further in 2025.

## AI-powered search

Search help with Copilot is designed to help you find information within the Sage Intacct Help Center and offers the following benefits:

-   **Natural language understanding**: Copilot understands the nuances of Sage Intacct terminology and can interpret complex queries.
-   **Increased efficiency**: Significantly reduces search time and the need for multiple searches by delivering more relevant results.
    
-   **Intelligent recommendations**: Provides suggestions for related topics and articles to expand your knowledge.

## How it works

When your company is enabled to use Search help with Copilot, you'll receive a welcome message when you login to Sage Intacct informing you that you can now see a new **Search help** option in the **Help & Support** menu.

Enter a query using natural language in the search box located at the bottom of the **Search help** panel. The more specific you are, the more accurate the results will be.

Copilot responds with an answer and provides links to additional information.

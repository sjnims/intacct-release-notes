## Details

There are three versions of the report:

- Variance analysis
- Variance analysis by department
- Variance analysis by location

If you install the version that reports by department or location, edit the report in the [Financial Report Writer](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=TOC_financial_report_tabs) after you've installed it. On the [Filters tab](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=GL_FinancialReportEditor_FiltersTab), add either a department group or a location group, depending on which report you installed. For details, see [To add a department or location group](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2025/2025_Release_1/Reporting-Financial/2025-R1-new-quickstart-variance-report.htm#To_add_a_department_or_location_group).

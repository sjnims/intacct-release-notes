# Changes to customer visibility

[Multi-entity customer restrictions](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Uploading_Customer_Visibility_List_IA)

Accounts Receivable

We’ve made minor adjustments to the workflow on the Customer visibility page and how you select restrictions on the customer record.

## Workflow changes on the Customer visibility page

When you select **Edit** for a customer on the Customer visibility page, Sage Intacct now opens the full customer record, directly on the Restrictions tab. After you save changes, you are returned to the Customer visibility page.

All changes you make to restrictions are captured in the audit trail, which is accessible from the customer record.

## User interface changes when selecting restrictions

Selecting locations or departments for customer restrictions now works similarly to adding entries in the customer contact list. Add a new restriction on an empty line by selecting a location or department from the dropdown list. If you run out of empty lines, select Add. To remove a line, select Delete.

# Sunset of customer payment service integrations this year

Our customer payment service integrations with Authorize.net and PayPal are going away on November 7, 2025.

This means that customer payment services will no longer be supported or work after this time. [Check out Versapay](https://www.versapay.com/lp/sage?utm_campaign=Sage%20marketplace%20promo&utm_source=email&utm_medium=Sage%20email%20promo#cta-form), a Sage recommended solution, to continue accepting customer payments in Sage Intacct.

## Details

Sage is working to reduce the amount of cardholder data we manage. This decision is not driven by any gaps in our security controls, but rather by a strategic goal to minimize the audit requirements associated with handling sensitive data. By exploring alternatives to storing and processing card data, we aim to enhance operational efficiency while maintaining the highest standards of security for customer information.

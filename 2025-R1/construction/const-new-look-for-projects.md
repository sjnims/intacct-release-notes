# There's a new look for projects associated with Construction

Streamlined project records now provide faster, focused insight on billings and resource price information.

Sage Intacct added new options to the Configure Projects page so that you can select the tabs that you want to appear on your projects.

![Shows options of tabs that you can display on projects with the Construction subscription.](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/Resources/Images/2025/2025-R1-images/2025-R1-select-tabs-to-display-on-projects.png)

## Details

- Admins must switch to the top level in Intacct to choose the tabs to display on projects.
- The following are new options on the Configure Projects page:
  - Project contracts tab
  - Project invoices tab
  - Resources and billing tab

    Previously known as the Resources and pricing tab.

- We removed the Invoice options tab and moved those sections to the Resources and billing tab.

## How it works

1.  Go to **Projects** > **Setup** > **Configuration**.
2.  Scroll to the **Additional options** section.
3.  Below **Display options for project**, select the checkboxes for the tabs that you want to display.

    The tabs that you choose appear on the Project information page.

4.  **Save** your changes.

## About the project invoices tab

View complete project billing information from a project. You can view project invoices and retainage release invoices assigned to a project. You can also view payments, credits, and adjustments used to pay for a project.

The **Project** invoices tab allows you to track project invoices, retainage release invoices, and payments from a project easily.

### Details

The following are project invoices:

Also, when you use AR payments, credits, or adjustments to pay for a project, that payment information appears on the **Project** invoices tab for the project. For more information, go to [Apply an AR credit to an invoice](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=HDI_AR_credit_apply_customer).

### View or export project invoices, retainage release invoices, or payments

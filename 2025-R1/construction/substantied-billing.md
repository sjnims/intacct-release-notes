You can now view and create reports with all dimensions from project and billed expenses. Plus, user-defined timesheet fields are now available for reporting. And, you can select attachments to download a zip file to archive included attachments on invoices (available for both Projects and Construction subscribers).

## Summary billing details tab

We enhanced the Summary billings tab on the time and materials invoices by including new fields and providing you with the ability to customize the layout. Use the fields from the Summary billing details tab in printed document templates to create time and materials documents. User-defined fields for timesheets are also now available on this tab.

The Summary billing details tab now includes:

- Dimensions in the original expense line that was billed on the invoice
- Dimensions from the project contract line associated to the expense

## Time and expenses page

View timesheet expenses to see exact details of each expense associated to a timesheet. We enhanced the Timesheet expenses page by adding the time type field and providing you with the ability to customize the layout. We also include user-defined fields to timesheet expense entries.

This enhancement aims to improve the detail and flexibility to timesheet entries. Use the fields from the Timesheet expense page in printed document templates to create time and materials documents.

The Time type field is included in the Timesheet expense page.

## View both summarized and non-summarized time and materials expenses billed on invoices

View summarized and non-summarized time and materials expenses billed on an invoice to see the exact details on expenses.

Previously, you could only view non-summarized time and materials expenses billed on an invoice. Now, Sage Intacct included both summarized and non-summarized expenses billed on an invoice so that you can view all expenses in one area.

## Download linked expense attachments

Previously, only specific subscribers could download attachments linked to expenses from time and materials invoices. Now, both Construction and Projects subscribers can download linked expense attachments.

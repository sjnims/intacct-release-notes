# Secondary vendors expand the usability of vendor compliance

[FAQs: Secondary vendor](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Secondary_vendor_FAQ)

[Secondary vendors and joint payees (4:11)](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2025/2025_Release_1/Construction/2025-R1-Secondary-vendor.htm#)

Construction

In the construction industry, general contractors often hire subcontractors to handle portions of their projects. These subcontractors may further engage secondary vendors to augment their workforce or to perform specialized tasks. For compliance purposes, general contractors must track all personnel working on their projects. Additionally, there are instances where the general contractor must issue joint payments to subcontractors and their secondary vendors.

You can now enter secondary vendors directly on your primary documents. These secondary vendors will appear on the Joint Payees tab in Accounts Payable (AP) Bills, allowing you to process joint payments efficiently.

## Details

We've introduced a new tab to track secondary vendors on primary documents.​

You can add, edit, or delete secondary vendors when the primary document is in a Draft, Pending, Partially converted, or Converted state. When you convert the primary document into an invoice, the secondary vendors are listed automatically as potential joint payees on the related Accounts Payable bill.

# Consolidated dashboards in Sage Intacct Project Intelligence

For multi-entity organizations operating in different base currencies, new dashboards are available that display consolidated data across all entities in a single base currency. The main dashboards provide data for individual locations in their functional currencies, while the new consolidated dashboards present a unified view of data from all entities in a common currency.

## Details

The main dashboards update automatically when you post. Consolidated dashboards display data from completed consolidations, and are updated only after running the consolidation process.

If you make changes for a previously consolidated month, you need to run the consolidation process again to update the dashboards.

## How it works

To access the consolidated dashboards:

1. Open the application switcher and select **Dashboards** > **Project Intelligence – Cons**.
2. Select the dashboard that you want to work with from the list.

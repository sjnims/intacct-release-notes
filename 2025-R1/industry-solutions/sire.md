## Import new charge amounts to existing recurring charges

You can now import recurring charge amounts, making it faster to add new charge amounts to existing recurring charges for existing leases. This is especially beneficial when starting a new period, during which new charge amounts are typically added to all leases.

## Manage lease renewals for multiple leases

Save time renewing leases by managing multiple leases in one process instead of renewing each lease individually:

-   Create, send, manage, and accept renewal offers.
-   When renewal offers are accepted, renew the leases.

## Generate and send tenant statements

Generate tenant statements and send them to tenants, ensuring that they are informed of their balances.

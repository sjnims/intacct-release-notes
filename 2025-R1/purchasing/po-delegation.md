Purchasing

Your team members can confidently enjoy their holiday time knowing that incoming purchase requests during an absence will not be held up when they’re away from the office. Delegation can be assigned to restricted users, and be set up for a specific timeframe.

![Set start and end dates for out-of-office in your preferences](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/Resources/Images/2025/2025-R1-images/2025-R1-po-approval-delegate-timeperiod.png)

## Details

When you assign a delegate approver, users and user groups with the required permission levels are available for selection. If a user in an approval group does not have the required permission, the approval request is automatically redirected to the next approver in the group.

Previously, delegation couldn’t be given to users who were restricted to specific departments and locations, and delegation could only be assigned to individual users.

## How it works

Need to get away? Book your time off and set up your out-of-office status. You or your administrator can set up approval delegates in the Purchasing configuration page. Your approval delegate will be kept updated with notifications on transactions that are waiting for approval.

### Enable approvals and set up delegate approvers

1. Go to **Purchasing** > **Setup** \> **Configuration** and scroll down to the Enable functionality section.
2. If not already configured, go to the **Approvals** subsection to select **Enable purchasing approval**, and then select **Enable delegation**.
3. To add delegates, select **Manage delegates**.  
    You can assign a user or a user group to each of your approvers.

### Set up your out-of-office period

1. If you’re the approver, select your login name at the top of any page and select **My preferences**.

Administrators can set up preferences for another user (**Company** \> **Admin** \> **User**).

1. Set email notifications for **Purchasing** transactions.
2. Select your approval delegates and the time period that you’ll be away.

To check on approvals which occurred while you were away, you can generate a report on all the approvals occurring in your absence. Add the column, Approver to a custom report.

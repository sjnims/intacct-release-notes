# Enhancements in EMRConnect

EMRConnect works with most delimited flat files that are exported from EMR (electronic medical records) systems. You can set up field mappings for as many formats as you need.

We've recently made EMRConnect even better with the following enhancements:

- When importing a value transformation, if a field is blank the value type is set to **Text**.
- For value transformations, you can now specify the number of decimal places to which numeric values are rounded.
- EMRConnect batches and GL entries now include links to each other, making it easy to switch back and forth for reviewing and referencing.
- The audit trail for EMRConnect batches tracks when an import file is downloaded and which user downloaded it.

Fixed Assets Management

We increased the maximum useful life for assets and updated the import service to improve your experience.

## Increased maximum useful life

We increased the maximum allowable useful life to support the depreciation of long-term assets such as land. You can now set a useful life of up to 1,500 months or 125 years when creating a depreciation rule. Previously, the limit was 500 months or 100 years.

## Import service updates

The import service received the following updates.

### Online processing for small imports

Imports of 10 assets or less are now processed online, making it easier for you to test your import file before running a full import. Error messages are displayed immediately in the import workspace, allowing you to correct them and import directly to Intacct without waiting for offline processing.

Imports with more than 10 assets are still processed offline. You'll be notified by email when an offline import completes and the errors are provided in a separate file.

### Welcome page

We added a welcome page where you can access help center topics and templates for available imports.

The welcome page also has links to the import actions, such as adding new information (create), or updating existing information where possible. As the import service expands, more imports will become available and their associated templates will be listed here.

### User interface improvements

We made various changes to the look and feel of the user interface for a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.

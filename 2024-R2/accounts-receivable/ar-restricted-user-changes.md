# Restricted user behavior in Accounts Receivable

To enforce the restrictions you place on users and to protect the integrity of your data, we made the following change to restricted user behavior.

Entity-restricted and department-restricted users cannot post edits that they make to invoices that contain line items outside their restrictions.

This change ensures that users are allowed to modify only transactions for which they have full visibility.

## Requirements

| Subscription | Accounts Receivable |
| --- | --- |
| Regional availability | All regions |
| User type | Business user |
| Permissions | Invoices: List, View, Edit |

# Easier access to payment files

You can now generate and access payment files for ACH and bank file payments in Accounts Payable, without needing to switch to Cash Management. This is useful when you want your AP clerks to manage the payment workflow within Accounts Payable, instead of accessing the Cash Management application.

## How it works

To give Accounts Payable users access to the **Payment files** submenu, grant ACH or Bank file permissions to users in Cash Management. Users who already have these permissions now see the Payment files submenu in Accounts Payable.

To access payment file options, go to **Accounts Payable** > **All** > **Payments** > **Payment files**.

# The latest features in Sage Construction Management

Sage Construction Management is an all-in-one cloud solution that provides a complete set of project management features. This solution aligns your operations and finance data so you can win more business and execute projects more efficiently. For more information, visit the [Sage Construction Management web page](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2024/2024_Release_2/Industry_solutions/2024-R2-sage-construction-mgmt.htm).

## Release retainage on prime invoices

You can now release retainage on prime invoices. When you release the retainage on the invoice, the retainage amount is sent to Sage Intacct.

In Intacct, the following happens for the applicable line entries:

-   The **Retainage release line** checkbox is automatically selected.
    
-   The amount is entered in the **Retainage to bill this period** field.
    

## Other enhancements

-   The [Sage Construction Management Support Portal](https://sagecm.freshdesk.com/support/home) is now available. To request an account to access the portal, send an email to our support team at SageCMSupport@Sage.com.
    
-   You now have more control over the appearance of the Checklists screen.
    
    -   Select the Show only checklists with open items checkbox above the grid to filter the list.
        
    -   Add columns that show the number of open and closed items in each checklist.

# Improved financial reporting for projects

This idea came from you

New reporting features make it faster and easier to get financial information about your projects.

## Details

When scheduling a report, you can now filter the report by project or project group. If you filter by project group, you can select **Individual report** to divide the report into separate sections for each project in the group.

In the Financial Report Writer, the **Project** filter (on the Filters tab) has a new **Run as individual reports** option. If you filter by all projects or by a project group, you can select this option to divide the report into separate sections for each project.

Generating individual reports for each project in a group works for project groups with up to 500 projects.

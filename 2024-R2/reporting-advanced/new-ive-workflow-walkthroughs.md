# IVE workflow walk-throughs

Interactive Visual Explorer (IVE) enables you to explore data with visualizations that illustrate your data's story. The workflow tasks walk you through using calculations, creating filters, and applying different visualizations to analyze data from different perspectives. This capability allows you to fully explore correlations and patterns, and discover trends.

## Details

The following workflows walk you through creating visual boards, applying calculations, and exploring the data with a variety of visualization types. Each workflow provides tasks that build on one another. It is recommended that you complete the workflows in the order listed.

- **Workflow 1: Report and chart visualizations** creates a Bills Analysis report visual board, applies calculations, and explores bar and donut chart visualizations.
- **Workflow 2: Table and chart visualizations** creates an Accounts Receivable table visual board, applies calculations, and explores scatter and pie chart visualizations.
- **Workflow 3: Pivot table and chart visualizations** creates a Bills Analysis Year over Year pivot table visual board, applies calculations, and explores combo, donut, and display tile visualizations.

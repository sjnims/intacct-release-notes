# New ICRW and IVE Reporting areas

New reporting areas are now available for Interactive Custom Report Writer (ICRW) and Interactive Visual Explorer (IVE).

-   A new **Cash Management (CM) Reconciliation Match** reporting area creates bank reconciliation match reports with the robust functionality of ICRW and IVE. For information on how this report can facilitate Cash Management reconciliations, see the [Quick reference guide for reconciliation](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Quick_ref_guide_reconciliation).
    
-   A new **Construction AP Payment Detail** reporting area creates reports with details on AP payments, adjustments, advances, and other transactions. For information on how this reporting area can facilitate AP invoices for construction projects, see [Generate project invoices](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=TOC_project_invoices).
    

## How it works

One of the first things you do when you create an ICRW report or IVE visualization, is to select a reporting area. A reporting area correlates data objects that provide specialized options. You can select the options you want to include in your report or visualization, customizing it to your needs.

1.  Review the [Reporting areas reference](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=ICRW_reporting_area_reference) for descriptions of available reporting areas to determine which one provides the data best suited for your report.
    
2.  Follow the instructions in [Selecting a reporting area](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Select_subject_area) for ICRW or [Create visualizations in IVE](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=IVE_new_visualizations).

# Introducing designated support users

We're excited to introduce designated support users. Your [designated support users](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Designated_support_user_resources) are authorized to contact Customer Support and log support cases.

Each company is provided with at least 2 designated support user licenses. For information about who your designated support users are, contact your admin.

Your designated support users can help you with the following types of issues:

-   Community login
    
-   Sage Intacct login and permissions
    
-   General product and reporting help
    
-   Accounting-related questions
    

If your designated support user isn't able to solve your issue, they are authorized to call Customer Support or log a support case.

Contact your account manager if you need to purchase additional designated support user licenses.

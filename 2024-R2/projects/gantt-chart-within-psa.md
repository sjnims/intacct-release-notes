# Report on resource plans in Professional Services Automation

To better align advanced resourcing capabilities, Sage Intacct is retiring our Gantt chart feature. Going forward, this type of resource planning view will be available through the Sage Intacct Professional Services Automation subscription.

This change will be effective November 2024 Release 4.

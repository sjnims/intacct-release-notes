# Work in progress (WIP) management—Early adopter

Use WIP schedules to track overbilling and underbilling and show the predicted profit at the end of your project. WIP schedules are useful for project managers, controllers, CFOs, and anyone monitoring the profitability of ongoing projects.

## Details

CFOs and project managers can use the interactive reporting tool to enter their own project cost and revenue forecasts to go along with data pulled from Sage Intacct Construction. Values are pulled from:

- Projects
- Estimates
- Contracts
- Recorded costs
- Customer billing

Each WIP schedule covers a specific period. The WIP schedule periods are based on the reporting periods that you already have set up in your entity.

Each row in the WIP projects section represents an ongoing project. Each column contains information for that project and the WIP schedule period.

## How it works

1.  Go to **Projects** > **All** > and select the **+** next to **WIP management**.

    Alternately, you can select **Create** on the WIP management list page.

2.  Select a **Period name**.

    The available options are based on the reporting periods that are set up for your entity. If a reporting period is already in use for a WIP schedule, it's not available in the list.

    After you select a reporting period as the period name, the projects that meet the WIP schedule criteria during that period are listed in the WIP projects section. You can start editing the project information.

3.  Select **Save**.
4.  When you're ready to post the over and under-billing totals for the month, select **Post**.

## What's the Early Adopter program?

The Early Adopter program provides qualified functionality to a specific set of customers who have a Sage Intacct Construction subscription. During this release, these early adopters will help us refine our offering to deliver the functionality that's critical for business controls.

The Early Adopter program is closely monitored. We work with the early adopters to ensure that we focus our time and attention on what matters most to you.

If you would like to consider being an early adopter, contact your Sage partner or your [Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

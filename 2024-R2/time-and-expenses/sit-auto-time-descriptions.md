# Automatically generate activity titles and descriptions with AI Assistant—Sage Intelligent Time

We've elevated our time entry experience by improving activity card titles and offering the option to generate time entry descriptions automatically using AI.

These features are currently in beta.

## Details

**Improved time entry descriptions**

Before, activity cards collected from the Time Assistant showed generic "Computer Activity" and "Other Windows" titles. Now, our AI Assistant generates more specific titles to better summarize your work and the windows you had open.

**Automated time entry descriptions**

Time entry descriptions are visible to approvers and can help them better understand your timesheet. Now you can generate these descriptions automatically. This feature is only available on time entries that were created from activity cards.

-   New activity cards moving forward have the option to generate time entry descriptions automatically.
    
-   If you manually enter or modify a description, then the option to generate automatically is not available.
    
-   Descriptions that are generated automatically display a badge that says "Powered by Ai".
    

## How it works

1.  Go to one of the following in Sage Intacct:
    
    -   **Time and Expenses** > **All** > **My timesheets**.
        
    -   **Projects** > **All** > **My timesheets**.  
        
    
    Or, log in to Sage Intelligent Time and go to **My timesheets**.
    
2.  Select a timesheet.
    
3.  Drag and drop an activity card to your timesheet.
    
4.  Next to the Description field, select **Draft with AI Assistant Beta**.
    
    A description of the time entry is automatically generated.

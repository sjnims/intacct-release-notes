# Announcing Fixed Assets Management

FIXED ASSETS Management

We're excited to announce Sage Fixed Assets Management (SFAM), a new solution designed for Sage Intacct, is available for everyone.

Now you can stop using spreadsheets or other systems that are manual, costly, and difficult to reconcile. Instead, automate and simplify the management of your assets from acquisition to disposal.

## Key features

Our native application offers seamless integration with other core applications, ensuring timely and accurate management of your fixed assets. And, the latest user interface enhancements provide even more control with the flexibility to customize and filter your pages.

Company and Administration

All customers who send emails using a custom domain must authenticate and validate their domain with the enhanced email delivery service.

This is a non-negotiable requirement as we transition fully to the enhanced email delivery service.

## Why is this important?

Authenticating your domain helps ensures uninterrupted email delivery from Intacct to your customers.

-   Improved email deliverability, reducing the chances of your messages being marked as spam or not reaching recipients.
    
-   Protects your domain from being used in phishing attacks or other fraudulent activities.
    
-   Aligns with best practices for email security and compliance.

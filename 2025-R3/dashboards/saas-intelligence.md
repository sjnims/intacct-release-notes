# Item mapping and bundling in SaaS Intelligence—Early Adopter

[Item mapping and bundling](https://bakertilly.clickhelp.co/articles/#!saas-intelligence-help/item-mapping-and-bundling)

[Sage Intacct SaaS Intelligence](https://www.sage.com/en-us/sage-business-cloud/intacct/product-capabilities/extended-capabilities/financial-reporting/saas-intelligence/) (sage.com)

DASHBOARDS, REPORTING & INSIGHTS

The item mapping and item bundling features allow you to substitute an old item or group of items with a new item on current or renewal subscriptions. Mapping substitutes one old item with one new item. Bundling substitutes multiple old items with one new item.

Before you set up mapping or bundling, the new items must be set up in Sage Intacct.

## Key benefit

You'll no longer see product churn on the old item or items. The new item acts as a replacement with committed monthly recurring revenue (CMRR) and quantity transferred.

If the new CMRR does not match the old CMRR, uplift or markdown is posted to the new item.

## How it works

On the Item Mapping page or the Item Bundle page, you set up the mapping or bundling by specifying the old and new items and other related information (such as item quantities).

INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS

## Increased automation for agreements

Agreement users can now set up Sage Field Operations to do the following automatically.

-   Generate agreement renewals ahead of the expiration date.
-   Approve the automatically-generated renewals.
-   Invoice approved renewals using the period billing lead time.
-   Generate PM schedules and work orders associated with renewals.
-   Set PM schedules as inactive based on the agreement period expiration.
-   Expire unapproved renewal offers after a specified period of time.

## Reports and metrics in the Business Intelligence Solution provide more data

-   In the Work Order Spotlight, there are new columns on the Work Order Activity table:
    -   **Sales Person**: Track and filter work orders by sales team members.
    -   **Invoice Date** and **Close Date**: Compare these dates to the Complete Date to monitor your billing team’s efficiency.
    -   **Entered By**: Run reports on how many work orders your team members generate in a given period of time.
-   In the Sales Spotlight, you can now see if a work order was created from an approved quote. Sales teams can monitor the status of their approved quotes to ensure that the next step of the workflow is being followed.
-   In the Management Spotlight, the Work In Progress View displays the Department, Call Type, and Problem Code for each work order. This helps you gain insight from the type of work that's still open.

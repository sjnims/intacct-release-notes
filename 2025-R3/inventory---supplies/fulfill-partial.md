INVENTORY CONTROL

We’re introducing powerful enhancements to Fulfillment to improve warehouse efficiency and order management.

-   **Support for partially fillable orders**: You can now pick, pack, ship, and invoice orders when you only have some of a customer's requested items in stock.
    
-   **Enhanced pick ticket for more directed picking**: Pick tickets now include detailed, real-time inventory data to guide warehouse staff more efficiently.
    
-   **Improved visibility**: When picking portions of a requested item, you can monitor the remaining quantities to be shipped.
    

## Key benefits

With more flexible and responsive order processing functionality, you can fully leverage fulfillment actions for all your warehouse team operations.

**Warehouse Managers** can streamline workflows by processing available items without delay. This allows the warehouse team to pick and ship available inventory even when the full quantity is not in stock.

1.  This order contains two line items. Only 2 of the first item are on hand. The two available items can be processed, and the remaining 3 will be shipped when inventory is restocked.
    
2.  The order is split into three groupings using the same order number:
    
    -   A row for the portion of items that are on hand, **Ready to pick**
        
    -   A row for remaining items not on hand, **Open**
        
    -   A row for the requested items that are available and in process, **Picked**.

**Customer service representatives** can better manage customer expectations with improved order tracking visibility for partial shipments. The original order quantity remains visible along with the remaining partial shipment split quantity.

**Warehouse pickers** have access to real-time tracked item information. Pick tickets now dynamically display the status of picked and allocated quantities according to bin. This ensures that the picker has accurate and clear instructions for items stored in bins.

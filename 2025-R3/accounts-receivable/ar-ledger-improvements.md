# More filter options in the AR Ledger report

[AR Ledger report](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Running_AR_Ledger_Reports)

Enjoy more filtering flexibility in the AR Ledger report. New filtering options help you refine your report data to target specific customers.

## Key benefits

-   **Greater reporting efficiency**: Run the AR Ledger report for multiple customers at once—no more generating reports one customer at a time or manually editing large exports in Excel.
    
-   **Flexible filtering options**: Select individual customers or define custom groups based on criteria such as geography, industry, or payment terms. This allows for more targeted and relevant reporting.
    
-   **Improved consistency**: The new filtering options mirror those already available in the Customer Aging report, creating an intuitive experience across reporting tools.
    
-   **Time savings**: Reduce the time spent preparing reports by eliminating repetitive steps and manual data cleanup. This is especially valuable if you manage high volumes of customer data.
    
-   **Enhanced accuracy**: By filtering directly within the report, you reduce the risk of errors introduced through manual editing or data manipulation outside Sage Intacct.
    

## How it works

New filter options include the following: 

-   Multiple customers: Select multiple customers, individually or in ranges
    
-   Customer group: Include customers based on an existing customer group
    
-   Include child customers: When filtering by range a range of customers, include child customer in the report
    

![The Select customers option opens a popup window where you can select customers individually or within ranges.](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/Resources/Images/2025/2025-R3-images/2025-R3-ar-ledger-customer-filters.png)

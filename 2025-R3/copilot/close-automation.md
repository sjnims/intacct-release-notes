Close Automation is a suite of tools designed to deliver a smoother, faster close. Use these features to streamline and accelerate your month-end close by tracking tasks, flagging issues, and guiding your team through each step. With Close Automation, you'll have less manual effort and more confidence.

## Key benefits

Close Automation includes the following features: 

- **Close Assistant** helps you manage standard period-end close tasks for core applications by providing an overview of activity in one place. You can glance at the Copilot panel to see which applications are closed and which tasks require attention.

- **Subledger Reconciliation Assistant** saves you time and effort by automating some of the tasks required to reconcile subledgers with General Ledger. Instead of exporting subledger reports and the Trial Balance report to Excel to compare balances, let Subledger Reconciliation Assistant do that for you.

- **Variance Analysis** alerts budget owners and finance leaders whenever actual spending exceeds your budget. Copilot notifications are designed to keep budget owners in the loop, whether it’s a timely update or an on-demand review. You can drill into report insights to see exactly how your budget is doing, including detailed breakdowns and visualizations.

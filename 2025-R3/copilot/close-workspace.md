We're excited to announce the release of Close Workspace for customers in the Sage Copilot Close Automation Early adopter program! The Close Workspace is a centralized environment for managing the period-close process. Designed to streamline workflows, enhance visibility, and reduce delays, this feature empowers finance teams to execute their close with greater confidence and efficiency.

## Key benefits

Close Workspace offers a suite of capabilities tailored to the needs of controllers, accountants, and other finance professionals involved in the period close process.

- **Template-based workflows**: Establish repeatable close procedures with customizable task templates.
- **Checklists with accountability**: Track every task, owner, and status for a consistent and complete close.
- **Proactive notifications**: Surface due dates, dependencies, and outstanding tasks before they become blockers.

## How it works

Close Workspace lets you create checklists of tasks related to your organization's close processes. You can then assign those tasks to the people responsible for completing them and monitor their progress from a central location.

Close Workspace automatically calculates the target start and completion date for each task based on information that you enter in the task template. There are Copilot-assisted tasks that come out-of-the-box, and you can create your own custom tasks to add to the checklist.

Based on the task target dates and other information, Copilot generates insights to alert task assignees of certain situations, such as when tasks are at risk or overdue. Assignees can view these insights in the Copilot panel, and you have the option to have Copilot send email notifications as well.

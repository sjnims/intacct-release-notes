# Upload digital signatures in PNG file format for use on checks

We added the PNG file format to the already supported JPG and GIF formats, giving the flexibility to choose from more formats when you create your digital signatures.

## Details

A digital signature is a scanned, digital image of your signature that's used to print a signature at the bottom of checks. Digital signatures can be used on checks that you print yourself and on checks sent through a payment service.

When creating a PNG digital signature file, the same requirements as for GIF and JPG files apply:

-   Frame size: 3.0" wide by 0.36" high, and the signature must fill the box
-   Resolution: 150 dpi
-   File color depth: 16-bit color
-   Background: White, not transparent
-   Maximum file size: 10KB

You can upload signatures on your Preferences page or to individual checking accounts. If you upload a signature on your Preferences page, that signature takes precedence over any signature uploaded on the checking accounts.

## How it works

From your checking account:

1.  Go to **Cash Management** > **All** or **Setup** > **Accounts** > **Checking**.
    
2.  In the Checking accounts list find the account that you want to edit.
3.  Select **More actions** > **Edit** at the end of the row.
    
4.  On the Check printing tab, in the Signatures section, select **Upload signature** and select **Choose Files**.
5.  Find the image file with your signature and select **Open**, and then select **Upload** and **Save**.

From your user preferences:

1.  Select your login name at the top of any page and select **My preferences**.
    
2.  In the Check preferences section, select **Upload signature**.
3.  On the Upload signature image page, select **Choose Files**.
4.  Find the image file with your signature and select **Open**.
5.  Select **Upload**, and then **Save** your preferences.

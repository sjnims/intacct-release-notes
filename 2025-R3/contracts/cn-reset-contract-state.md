# Update contract states to Renewed or Not renewed

[Update contract state to Renewed or Not renewed](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Update_contract_state)

Contracts

We added new actions to help you update contracts that need to be transitioned to Renewed or Not renewed. These actions give you more control and help keep your contract data accurate and up to date.

## Key benefits

-   **Fix contract states**: Easily update contracts that are still in the In progress state.
    
-   **Save time**: Resolve issues directly from the contract record without needing additional support.
    

## What's changed

When viewing an in-progress contract that needs a state update, you’ll now see one of the following actions in the More actions menu:

-   Update contract state to Renewed
    
-   Update contract state to Not renewed

These actions also update the contract line states. After the update is complete, the action is no longer available in the menu.

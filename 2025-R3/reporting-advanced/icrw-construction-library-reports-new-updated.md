ADVANCED REPORTING

Several enhanced Construction reports are now available for the ICRW Report library.

ICRW requires a separate subscription. For information on attaining an ICRW subscription, [contact your Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

The ICRW Report library provides prebuilt reports for you to view, copy, and use as a template for your own reports. After making a copy of a library report, you can customize it to fit your needs.

For more information, see the [ICRW Report library](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=TOC-ICRW-report-library).

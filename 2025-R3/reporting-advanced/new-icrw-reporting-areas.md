ICRW and IVE require separate subscriptions. To purchase or enable ICRW and IVE subscriptions, [contact your Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_ma).

## How it works

One of the first things you do when you create an ICRW report or IVE visualization, is to select a reporting area. A reporting area correlates data objects that provide specialized options. You can select the options you want to include in your report or visualization, customizing it to your needs.

1.  Review the [Reporting areas reference](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=ICRW_reporting_area_reference) for descriptions of available reporting areas to determine which one provides the data best suited for your report.
2.  Follow the instructions in [Selecting a reporting area](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Select_subject_area) for ICRW or [Create visualizations in IVE](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=IVE_new_visualizations).

# Help content enhancements

[About enhanced lists](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=About_lists_ng)

User Experience

We're introducing two new enhancements to improve your Sage Intacct content experience:

-   User interface content toggle
-   Language switcher

## User interface content toggle

We're continuing to roll out our [enhanced interface](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2025/2025_Release_3/User_Experience/2025-R3-next-gen-lists.htm), and we want to make sure you always have the right instructions at your fingertips.

You'll now find a handy toggle on relevant online help pages. This lets you easily switch between instructions for our existing interface and the new, enhanced one. So, no matter which version you're using, you can quickly find the how-to information you need.

![Shows the Enhanced interface toggle below the search bar on a help page.](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/Resources/Images/2025/2025-R3-images/2025-R3-ui-toggle.png)

Not all applicable help topics currently have instructions for both interfaces. We're updating content as part of an effort to support the enhanced experience.

## Language switcher

We added a language switcher to the top of the help content and release notes, making it easier to view documentation in your preferred language. Selecting a language will load the corresponding translated version of the current page.

If a page is not available in the selected language, the page will fall back to the English (US) version.

# Update assets in bulk using the import service

[Update assets](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=TOC_update_assets)

Fixed Assets Management

You can now update assets in bulk using the import service, saving time and reducing manual effort. This enhancement lets you perform the following actions for multiple assets at once:

- Place assets in service
- Dispose of assets
- Transfer assets
- Place assets back in review
- Place assets back in service
- Update asset details

## Key benefits

- **Save time and effort:** Update multiple assets at once instead of modifying each one manually.
- **Simplify workflows:** Streamline asset management with an easy-to-use import process.
- **Scale with ease:** Efficiently manage large asset portfolios as your organization grows.

## What's changed

Previously, you could only update asset details and change asset states one at a time. Now, a new **Update** option in the import service lets you modify assets in bulk.

## How it works

1.  Export the **Assets** list to Excel.
2.  Update asset fields in the Excel sheet.
3.  Import the updated sheet back into Intacct.

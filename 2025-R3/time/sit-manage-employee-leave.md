# Manage employee leave within timesheets—Sage Intelligent Time—Early Adopter

We now provide the ability to manage employee leave directly within timesheets using Sage Intelligent Time (SIT). You can more easily track leave requests, approval workflows, and time balances. This helps ensure precise payroll processing and legal compliance.

## Key benefits

-   **Leave requests**: A user-friendly interface for employees to submit leave requests, specifying the type of leave, duration, and reason.
    
-   **Approval workflows**: Approval workflows are streamlined to ensure timely processing of leave requests, enhancing employee satisfaction and planning.
    
-   **Leave tracking**: Accurate tracking of leave balances, accrual rates, and blackout periods, reducing errors and disputes.
    
-   **Reporting**: Detailed reporting capabilities that provide insights into leave patterns, helping HR administrators manage resources effectively.
    

## How it works

1.  An admin sets up approvals for leave requests.
    
2.  Employees create and submit leave requests.
    
3.  Users assigned the appropriate approval permissions can approve or decline an employee's leave request. Employees are notified when their leave request is approved or declined.

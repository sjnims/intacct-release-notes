## How it works

### Customize the timesheet entry grid

1.  An admin creates or updates a timesheet for an employee.

    For more information, go to [Create a staff timesheet](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=IT_create_staff_timesheet) or [Enter time manually](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Enter_time_manually).

2.  On the Staff timesheet page, you can customize the time entries table.

    For more information, go to [Customize line-item entry fields](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Customize_bill_line_item_entry) or [Customize a transaction's Entries grid layout](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Edit_Entries_layout_SCM).

3.  Then, save your layout changes. You can apply the layout changes to the Create, Edit, and View pages.

### Add notes and dimensions to entries

1.  Create or update a timesheet for yourself or an employee.

    For more information, go to [Enter time manually](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Enter_time_manually).

2.  After you enter the required fields and hours worked, select **Add notes**.
3.  Then, you can include notes and dimensions in the entries. This will appear in the timesheet automatically.

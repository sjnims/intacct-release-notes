# Pay bills from the Vendors list

[Pay a vendor from the Vendors list](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Pay_from_vendors_list)

Accounts Payable

Pay a vendor directly from the Vendors list without interrupting your workflow, using the **Pay** option.

## What's new

The **Pay** option appears for each vendor in the Vendors list when you have the appropriate permissions to pay bills. When you select **Pay** for a vendor, a Pay bills window appears, showing the vendor's open bills.

-   The **Pay** option appears for all vendors, regardless of their state or total due.
-   **Pay** is available at both the top level and entity level.
-   There are some conditions when bills cannot be paid from the Vendors list and must be paid from Pay bills, instead. The Help Center provides more information about these conditions.

## Key benefits

-   Reduces the number of steps required to make payments to a single vendor.
    
-   Allows you to make payments while staying on the Vendors list.
    
-   Improves efficiency for Accounts Payable clerks who manage transactions by vendor.
    
-   All actions are logged in the Posted payments audit trail.
    

## Good to know

When you select Pay, Sage Intacct opens the Pay bills page and displays open bills for the selected vendor. If you have a default advanced filter set up in Pay bills, it is automatically applied to the list.

Intacct shows bills with the same currency of your default bank. If you have no default bank set in Configure Accounts Payable, Intacct loads bills that match your base currency.

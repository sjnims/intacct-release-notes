Accounts Payable

Introducing a new way to manage vendor payments directly within Sage Intacct through our seamless integration with MineralTree. This new payment service supports all your entities in Sage Intacct, along with your bill workflows and payment approvals. If you use AP Automation, you can add Vendor Payments to your existing automated transaction and approval workflows for a complete end-to-end automation solution.

## Key benefits

Vendor Payments powered by MineralTree allows you to do the following: 

- Seamlessly pay vendors with ACH, virtual card, or check directly within Sage Intacct from your existing bank accounts.
- Maintain vendor payment preferences and automatically send detailed remittances.
- Direct debit funding for faster payments and simpler bank reconciliations compared to solutions that require settlement accounts.
- Earn cash-back rebates on virtual card spending.

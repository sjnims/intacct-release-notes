# Smarter email capabilities for AP Automation with Purchasing

We're introducing a new email domain that provides an enhanced email experience. The new email domain supports auto-forwarding rules, inline attachments, and email body extraction. Take advantage of the smart email capabilities now to get a head start.

The new date for all companies to move automatically to the new email domain is February 2026. This update gives you more time to prepare and notify your vendors of the upcoming change. Previously, we announced that all companies would be moved to the new email domain in November 2025.

## Key benefits

With smarter email capabilities, you'll get the following benefits:

-   **Auto-forwarding rules**: Save time with auto-forwarding rules, so you do not have to forward each email to your automation email manually.
-   **Inline attachments**: Attachments that are in the email body are now extracted for processing.
-   **Text from email body**: Transactions can now be read even when they're in the email body as text, not just when added as an attachment.
-   **iPhone image support**: We now support iPhone images in the HEIC file format for incoming attachments.
    
    This format is not supported for split view, but you can download the attachment to compare transaction details.
    

## How it works

After you're on the new email address domain, your email addresses change from @sagemail.com to @ai.sage.com.

-   Go to **Accounts Payable** > **Setup** > **Configuration** to see your automation email addresses.
    

### If your company already uses AP Automation

You can opt in to this new email service.

1.  Log a support case to opt in to smarter email capabilities for AP Automation.
    
2.  After Support confirms that your inbox has been switched, go to **Accounts Payable** > **Setup** > **Configuration** to see your new email addresses.
    
3.  Communicate with any vendors who send their invoices directly to your automation inbox that you have a new email address.
    

After your email address changes, you cannot switch back to the previous automation email address.

### If your company is new to AP Automation

All companies that subscribe to AP Automation after May 2025 are automatically set up on this new email option. There are no additional steps that you need to take. Your email address domain is @ai.sage.com.

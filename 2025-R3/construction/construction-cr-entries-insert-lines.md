# Improved change request grid with entry reordering and line numbers

[Add a change request](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Add_change_request)

Construction

This idea came from you

Get greater control over how line entries are organized and displayed in change requests to improve your change management processes.

## Why the change

Change requests often require additions of new tasks and materials. Now, you can organize entries by task or workflow to improve clarity and communication on printed documents in a way that makes sense to approvers. Previously, any additions were appended to the end of the entries list.

## What's changed

The change request grid now includes the following new features that make it easier to organize, view, and manage entries:

- **Drag-and-drop reordering**: A new drag handle (hamburger icon) lets you move entries to new positions in the grid.
- **Consistent print order**: Printed documents now reflect the order that appears in the grid based on new line numbers.

## How it works

Adjust and add new change request line entries when you add a new change request or edit an existing change request.

1.  Go to **Projects** \> **Change management** > **Change requests**.
2.  Select **Create** to create a new change request.

    Or, select More actions and select **Edit** to edit a change request.

3.  In the Entries section, you can now do the following:
    1.  Drag-and-drop line entries using the drag handle on the left of the page.
    2.  Add a new line entry using the Add icon.

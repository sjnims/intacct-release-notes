CONSTRUCTION

During the course of a project you might have multiple estimates as changes arise. As the list of estimates grows, it can be time consuming to find the one you want.

You can now set a specific estimate as the primary project estimate forecast for quick access.

Forecast reports present information in different ways and time periods, providing insights into the outcome for a project. Forecasts rely on historical data to produce estimated views. Accurate forecasts for defined periods throughout the course of a project can ensure that a project finishes on time and on budget.

## Key benefits

Marking an estimate as a primary forecast allows you to quickly identify the estimate as the forecast estimate.

## What's new

There's now a Primary Forecast checkbox available on Project estimates. You can select the Primary Forecast checkbox on any estimate for the project estimate. However, only one estimate per project can be set as a primary forecast.

## How it works

To set a primary project estimate forecast, select the **Primary Forecast** checkbox in the Estimate information section of the Project estimate page.

Only one estimate per project can be set as a primary forecast.

If you select the Primary Forecast checkbox on an estimate and another estimate was previously selected as a primary forecast, the checkbox is cleared on the other estimate. The newly selected estimate is then set as the primary forecast.

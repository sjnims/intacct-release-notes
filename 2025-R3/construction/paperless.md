# Enhancements in Sage Intacct Paperless

[Sage Intacct Paperless](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Paperless_for_construction)

CONSTRUCTION

Improve and modernize your paper-heavy accounts payable document workflow. Sage Intacct Paperless is an intelligent, automated solution that lets you capture, index, route, and store documents in one secure place.

In this release, you can find these enhancements:

- **Expanded invoice entry sidebar in Invoice Manager**: Find invoices based on any header field on the invoices. Also, mark invoices as **Do Not Pay** to prevent them from being exported into accounting.
- **Tasks with indexes**: When setting up **Attach Document** tasks in DocRoute and APFlow, you can now configure specific indexes that must be found on the attached document to complete the assigned task.
- **Project Manager field**: In invoice entry, for line types that have job costing, we’ve added a **Project manager** field. It automatically shows data based on the job coding, and can be used to set up routing rules based on the project manager in APFlow.

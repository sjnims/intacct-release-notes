# Update project contract customer after billing

This idea came from you  

You can now update the customer on a project contract even after the contract has been billed. Invoices created before the change in customer are not updated.

## Key benefits

With the ability to update project contract customers after billing, you'll get the following benefits:

-   **Operational control**: Easily manage customer records or project reassignments.
    
-   **Data integrity**: Maintain accurate customer data across your project and billing workflows.
    
    For example, say a customer changes mid-project and you have to make an adjustment. You can now update the customer on the project contract, even if it's already been billed.
    

## How it works

1.  Go to **Projects** \> **All** \> **Project contracts**.
    
2.  Find the project contract that you want to update.
    
3.  Select More actions and select **Edit**.
    
4.  Select a **Customer**.
    
5.  Select **Save**.

# Lettrage enhancements for greater efficiency and visibility

[Lettrage for General Ledger](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=ab-toc-lettrage)

General Ledger

We've made several enhancements to lettrage so that you can reconcile accounts more effectively.

## Key benefits

-   The lettrage transactions list now displays unmatched transactions that originated in subledgers. This update ensures that you can reconcile accounts more effectively by matching all relevant transactions, including those from Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, and Cash Management.
    
-   To make it easier to find unmatched transactions, you are no longer required to enter a reporting period when filtering transactions.
    
-   To prevent data issues, you're not allowed to edit a matched transaction. If you need to make a change, you must unmatch the transaction before you can edit it.
    
-   To provide greater visibility, three new columns have been added to the transactions list on the Lettrage page:
    
    -   Matching date: The date that the transaction was matched
        
    -   Location: The location associated with the transaction
        
    -   Memo: The memo information entered for the transaction
        
-   It's easier to find a particular transaction now that you can select any column heading in the transactions list to sort by that column.

Projects

Projects has updated the way you add multiple standard tasks to the project in a single bulk action.

## Key benefits

You can now add multiple standard tasks to a project at once, using the new **Add to project** bulk action option now available on the Standard task catalog page. This feature expedites the process for adding tasks to a project.

## How it works

1.  Go to the Projects **Standard task catalog**.
2.  Select the tasks you want to add to a project.
3.  Select **Add to project**, then choose the project name from the dropdown list.
4.  Select **Save**.

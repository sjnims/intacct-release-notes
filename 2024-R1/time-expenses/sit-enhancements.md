# Sage Intelligent Time enhancements

Time & Expenses

We've added a print functionality for timesheets, introduced filtering and sorting for improved usability, added Construction dimensions, and upgraded the smart time entry experience. These features are available for both the embedded—Early Adopter and standalone versions of Sage Intelligent Time, unless otherwise specified.

## Print timesheets

You can now easily download and print timesheets to have physical copies for your records or for submission.

The Print timesheets feature is only available for the embedded version of Sage Intelligent Time.

To print, timesheets must have at least 1 time entry and be synced to Intacct or submitted. Admins can sync draft timesheets to Intacct to make drafts available for printing.

### How it works

1. Go to the My Timesheets or Staff Timesheets page.
2. Select a timesheet that you want to print.
3. At the top right of the page, select **Print**.

    The timesheet opens in a print-friendly PDF preview for you to print or download.

## Sort and filter timesheets

On the My Timesheets or Staff Timesheets pages, users can now filter and sort columns to quickly find the timesheets they need. Additionally, when viewing a timesheet, users can sort the time entry columns.

### How it works

- On the My Timesheets or Staff Timesheets page, enter a value in the text box at the top of the column. The list returns all rows that contain that value.
- On the My Timesheets or Staff Timesheets page, select a column header to sort the column by ascending or descending order.
- When viewing a timesheet, select a column header in the Time Entries table to sort the column by ascending or descending order.

## Construction dimensions

If your company is subscribed to Construction, the following dimensions are now available to add to time entries in Sage Intelligent Time:

- Employee position
- Labor class
- Labor shift
- Labor union

### How it works

1. Open a timesheet.
2. Select the **Edit notes** icon to the right of a time entry.

    The **Edit notes** icon only appears next to entries that have time entered.

3. In the Dimensions section, select an Employee position, Labor class, Labor shift, or Labor union.
4. Select **OK**.

## Upgraded experience for smart time entry

We released a new version of the Time Assistant and enhanced our time entry predictions:

- The Time Assistant has a fresh look and feel.
- The Time Assistant now operates more efficiently, using less processing power on your computer.
- The Time Assistant is now available to download from the Apple App Store.
- We upgraded our machine learning algorithms, making AI time entry predictions smarter and more accurate.

To get the new version of the Time Assistant, you must redownload and install the application. Afterward, future releases will update automatically.

[What's the Time Assistant?](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2024/2024_Release_1/Time_Expenses/2024-R1-SIT-enhancements.htm#)

The Time Assistant is a desktop application that captures the time you spend on your computer. It collects which applications are active, the name of the window or tab, and timestamps. SIT uses this information to create activity cards that you can choose to add to your timesheet. It does not collect any keystrokes you make, your location, or any other data.

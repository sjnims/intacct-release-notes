# Use kit items in more billing scenarios

In a previous release, we added the ability to bundle products on contract lines using kit items. Kit items were limited for use with only the "Include with every invoice" contract line **Flat/fixed amount frequency** option.

You can now also use kit items with contract lines where the **Flat/fixed amount frequency** is either "One time" or "Use billing template".

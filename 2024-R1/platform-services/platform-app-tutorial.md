# Take the updated Platform Application Tutorial

You might remember that we previously offered a Platform Application tutorial. The tutorial helped you to become familiar with Platform Services and create an application. In case you missed it, in December we republished it with updates.

## Details

We removed sections of the tutorial that are no longer relevant. We also updated the images to reflect our current user interface. If you've always wanted to learn how to create a Platform application, [we encourage you to check out the updated Platform Application tutorial](https://developer.intacct.com/platform-services/platform-app-tutorial/).

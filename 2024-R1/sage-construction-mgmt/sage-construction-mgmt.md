# Latest enhancements in Sage Construction Management

Recent enchantments in Sage Construction Management make it easier to exchange information with Sage Intacct. The following changes were made in AccountingLink for Sage Intacct.

- Use the new Department Mapping section to assign a default department to all jobs or to set up a project-specific department.

  ![The Department Mapping fields. ](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/Resources/Images/2024/2024-R1-images/2024-R1-SCM-Department-Mapping.png)

- Map your Sage Construction Management tax codes to Intacct items created for this purpose. This allows you to send the correct tax rate for transaction lines when the transactions are sent to Intacct.

  ![The Tax Codes tab on the Posting Preferences screen. ](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/Resources/Images/2024/2024-R1-images/2024-R1-SCM-Tax-Codes-Mapping.png)

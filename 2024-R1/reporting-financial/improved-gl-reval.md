# Concise General Ledger revaluation reports with new summary format

You can now run your General Ledger (GL) revaluation report in summary format and group your data by account, location, and transaction currency. This makes for crisp, clear GL revaluation reports that are easy to scan, particularly if your Intacct company includes a high volume of foreign currency transactions.

## Details

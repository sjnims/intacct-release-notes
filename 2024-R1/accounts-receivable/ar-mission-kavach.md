# Other updates in Accounts Receivable

If you're a user who's restricted by location or department, you can no longer reverse invoices and payments that have line items for locations and departments that you're restricted from accessing.

Instead, have a user that is not restricted by location or department reverse the invoice or payment.

## Requirements

| Subscription | Accounts Receivable |
| --- | --- |
| Regional availability | All regions |
| User type | Business user |
| Permissions | Invoices: List, View, Reverse |
| Configuration | This update impacts companies that restrict users from specific locations and departments. |

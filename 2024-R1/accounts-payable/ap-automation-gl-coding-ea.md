# Line-level GL account and dimension coding for AP Automation—Early Adopter

Increase the accuracy of automated draft bills with our latest enhancements to GL account and dimension coding, providing intelligent predictions at the line level.

Previously, AP Automation populated the line item dimensions in draft bills based on the coding you used in the most recent bill from the vendor. While this works in many cases, you might want more dynamic dimension coding that's not limited by the number of lines included in the previous bill.

With the latest improvements, AP Automation detects patterns in how you select dimension values for individual line items. This means that over time, as machine learning recognizes changes that you repeat, Sage Intacct is able to create draft bills that include the dimension values you intend. You spend less time correcting coding details and can post bills more quickly.

Ready to increase the value of AP Automation with improved GL account and dimension coding? Contact your account manager to ask about becoming an Early Adopter.

After you enable GL account and dimension coding, it becomes a permanent change to your AP Automation configuration. You cannot deactivate the enhanced functionality.

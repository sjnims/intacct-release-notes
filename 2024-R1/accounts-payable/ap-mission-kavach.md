# Other updates in Accounts Payable

This release brings the following updates to Accounts Payable.

## Restricted users reversing transactions

If you're a user who's restricted by location or department, you can no longer reverse bills and payments that have line items for locations and departments that you're restricted from accessing.

Instead, have a user that is not restricted by location or department reverse the bill or payment.

## Delete shared advanced filters

Administrative users can now delete advanced filters that another user created and shared on the Pay bills page.

Previously, if a user created and deployed advanced filters but then had their account deactivated for any reason, there was no easy way to remove the shared advanced filters. Now, a user with admin privileges can remove shared filters by deleting them from the Advanced Filters page in Pay bills.

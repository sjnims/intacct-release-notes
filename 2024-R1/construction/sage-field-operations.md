# Enhancements in Sage Field Operations mobile app

[Sage Field Operations](https://www.sage.com/en-us/products/sage-field-operations/) syncs seamlessly with Sage Intacct whether you're in the office or in the field. Office staff have to-the-minute information for scheduling. And the mobile app provides your team in the field with the critical information that they need, when they need it.

Sage Field Operations is available for Sage Intacct customers in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

For more information, talk to your [Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

We've recently made improvements to the mobile app to cut down on the time needed to complete tasks.

-   You can punch in and out of an assignment on the current day from the Assignments list instead of opening the assignment record.
    
-   The new condensed view shows more pertinent information.
    
    -   Expand the assignment record to see more details.
        
    -   Tap the eye ( ![](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/Resources/Images/2024/2024-R1-images/2024-R1-sfo-eye-icon.png) ) button to view the full assignment or work order.
        
    -   For work orders, tap the **Directions** button to open your default maps application to get directions.

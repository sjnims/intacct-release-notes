# Project contract billing details in Accounts Receivable invoices

You can now view the latest billing totals for project contract lines and project contracts within invoices. We added the **Project contract billing details** tab on to Accounts Receivable invoices to give you more visibility into the project contract details, including the amounts used for payment application during billing.

No more duplicate lines! For unsummarized time and materials invoices, the billing details are summarized by project contract line.

## Details

You can access the **Project contract billing details** tab when you view an invoice that's associated with a project contract. Also, you can create new invoice templates that use merge fields to include the totals from this tab.

This new tab shows information as you would see on a typical payment application form and continuation sheet. Each line displays retainage held and billed totals. Unsummarized time and materials invoices show billing details that are summarized by project contract line.

## How it works

1. Go to **Accounts Receivable** > **All tab** > and select Invoices.
2. Find an invoice and select **View**.
3. Select the **Project contract billing details** tab.

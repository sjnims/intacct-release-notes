# Better visibility into commitment compliance

View and manage the compliance records associated with your Purchasing commitments on the new **Commitment compliance** tab. This tab contains all insurance, lien waiver, and miscellaneous compliance records associated with the primary document. You can also add, edit, and delete compliance records from the **Commitment compliance** tab.

## How it works

You can add insurance and miscellaneous compliance records directly from this tab when the commitment is **not** in the following states:

-   In progress
    
-   Submitted
    
-   Partially approved
    
-   Exception
    

### Add a compliance record

1.  Go to **Purchasing** > **All tab** > **Transactions** > and select **Purchase order** or **Subcontract**.
    
2.  Find the appropriate transaction and select **Edit**.
    
3.  Select the **Commitment compliance** tab.
    
4.  Select **Add**.
    
5.  Select a **Compliance type ID**.
    
    The **Compliance record name** populates automatically, but you can change it.
    
6.  Enter the **Compliance details**.
    
7.  **Save** your changes.
    
8.  Select **Post**.
    

Sage Intacct generates lien waiver compliance records automatically when you add a bill. You can view lien waivers on this tab, but not add them.

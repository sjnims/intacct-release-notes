Sage Field Operations

Sage Field Operations provides accounting and billing teams with powerful tools to manage invoices efficiently and streamline Accounts Receivable processes. The Invoice Manager now offers advanced filters, giving you precise control over how you view and manage invoice data.

- A new Manager Filters table enables custom filtering across 10 key invoice fields. The fields include Invoice #, AR (Accounts Receivable) customer, Invoice date, and Location, with appropriate filter options for each field type.
- Use standard and quick filters to build complex multi-field searches or simple single-criteria views for your most common invoice queries.
- Customizable table columns allow you to display only the invoice data most relevant to your workflow, with your preferences saved across sessions.

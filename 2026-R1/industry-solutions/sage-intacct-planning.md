Budgeting and Planning

Sage Intacct Planning (SIP) now includes enhancements that make budgeting faster and more flexible. You can sync accounts and dimensions anytime, easily adjust annual totals, and view clearer dependencies. SIP also supports saving plans as Intacct budgets for reporting and enables creating multi-year plans.

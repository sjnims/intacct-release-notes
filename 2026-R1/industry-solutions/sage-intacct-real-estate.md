Real Estate

Sage Intacct Real Estate now includes enhancements that make property management easier. These updates improve portfolio visibility and add flexibility to reporting, communication, and billing workflows.

Sage Intacct Real Estate is an additional subscription. Your company must be subscribed to the core applications and Web Services to use Sage Intacct Real Estate. To learn more, contact your Sage Intacct account manager.

## New Operations dashboard

The new Operations dashboard gives you a single view of daily property management activities. It highlights key data and upcoming events so that you can prioritize tasks and work more efficiently.

-   **Track essential metrics at a glance**: Monitor real-time performance data including rent charges, occupancy rates (by unit or square footage), and total delinquencies.
    
-   **Manage occupancy and lease events**: Use the integrated calendar view to track move-ins, move-outs, lease expirations, and scheduled rent increases.
    
-   **Focus on compliance and risk**: A dedicated table view highlights delinquent tenants and pending renewals, allowing you to take action directly from the dashboard.
    
-   **Improve visibility**: Eliminate the need to switch between multiple pages to get a complete understanding of your portfolio's health.
    

## Enhanced report center

Find your most frequently used reports easily with a new tab structure and personalized favorites functionality. This update streamlines navigation, allowing you to switch between standard and custom reports quickly.

-   **Access favorites instantly**: Use the new Favorites tab to view all standard and custom reports that you have marked with the star icon. This tab is opened by default.
    
-   **Navigate efficiently with new tabs**: Easily toggle between "Favorites", "All Reports", and "Custom Reports" to find specific data sets.
    
-   **Personalize your workspace**:: Star icons next to each report to curate your own list. Selections are stored at the user level and persist across sessions.
    
-   **Maintain organization**: Reports within each tab are automatically sorted alphabetically, with standard reports appearing before custom reports in the combined view.
    

## Customizable email templates

The new template builder allows you to create professional, branded emails for tenants, property managers, and lease administrators. It replaces static templates, making it easier to align messages with your brand and meet different stakeholder needs.

-   **Reflect your brand**: Add your company logo and customize the wording and structure of emails. This ensures a consistent look and feel across all outgoing messages.
    
-   **Create responsive messages**: Use the intuitive editor to build attractive, mobile-friendly emails for any recipient without needing to write HTML (HyperText Markup Language) code.
    
-   **Automate personalization**: Insert contact-, property-, and lease-specific fields using merge tags to save time while maintaining a personal touch for different stakeholders.
    
-   **Improve deliverability and professionalism**: Ensure compliance and professional formatting for all outreach, including tenant notices, internal property manager alerts, and lease administration updates.
    

## Improved billing and proration logic

Standardized logic for non-monthly recurring charges ensures that proration and billing dates remain consistent, even for complex leases with mixed billing frequencies.

-   **Standardize non-monthly billing**: Weekly, biweekly, quarterly, and annual frequencies now follow consistent proration rules based on your property's specific Occupancy Control settings.
    
-   **Automate termination proration**: Sage Intacct Real Estate accurately calculates final charges when a lease terminates mid-cycle for non-monthly frequencies, ensuring you never over- or under-bill.
    
-   **Improve next-date accuracy**: Enhanced logic ensures that next-charge dates for weekly (+7 days) and biweekly (+14 days) frequencies advance correctly, regardless of month-end cutoffs.
    
-   **Support mixed frequencies**: Leases containing both monthly and non-monthly charges now process each recurring item according to its own independent frequency rules.

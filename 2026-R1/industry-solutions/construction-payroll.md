Construction payroll

Sage Intacct Construction Payroll handles construction payroll complexities not found in general payroll solutions. This solution provides a complete view of your project costs with unprecedented visibility into each cost component.

We're excited to the latest feature improvements:

-   Previously, the checks window allowed for manual adjustments of hours, pay rates, notes, deductions, and reimbursements but did not support overrides of calculated tax information. Now, additional functionality has been added to the checks window, allowing you to edit the following:
    
    -   Employee and employer portions of 401(k), pre-tax, after tax, primary contribution, and catch-up contribution.
        
    -   Employee and employee tax amounts with the ability to view taxable and taxed earnings during the override.
        
-   Additional changes have been made for federal and state certified payroll reports to support more cash fringe calculation and reporting scenarios.
    
    -   This impacts the federal WH-347 reports and state-specific certified payroll report options.
        
-   Enhanced reporting performance allows easier access to payroll reporting data elements within the standard ICRW reporting.
    
-   The check generation process has been enhanced to handle scenarios where company-paid benefit definitions on the prevailing wage table differ from those on the default cash fringe record.

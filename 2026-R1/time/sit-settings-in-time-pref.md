# Sage Intelligent Time settings are now centralized in Time preferences

[Time preferences—Sage Intelligent Time](https://preview.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Time_preferences)

[Configure Time](https://preview.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Configure_time)

time

Previously, the Time settings were only on the Configure Time page. Now, these settings also appear on the Time preferences page, centralizing all settings that affect Sage Intelligent Time in one location.

## Key benefits

- Enhanced user experience for admins and employees
- Ensured consistency across time tracking and reporting
- Improved integration and automation across applications

## How it works

[View Time settings on the Time preferences page](https://preview.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2026/2026_Release_1/Time/2026-R1-SIT-settings-in-time-pref.htm#)

1. **Time** > **Setup** > **Time preferences**.
2. Select **Time settings**.

[Update Time settings on the Configure Time page](https://preview.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2026/2026_Release_1/Time/2026-R1-SIT-settings-in-time-pref.htm#)

1. **Time** > **Setup** > **Configuration**.
2. Make your changes.
3. Select **Save**.

## What's changed

[The following settings are on the Time preferences and Configure Time pages:](https://preview.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2026/2026_Release_1/Time/2026-R1-SIT-settings-in-time-pref.htm#)

- Timesheet settings
- Timesheet rules
- Timesheet table display
- Timesheets approval settings
- Timesheet GL posting

## Good to know

- The Time settings on the Time preferences page are ready only. You can update these settings on the Configure Time page.
- This change is effective only if you’re subscribed to Time (and Expenses) with Sage Intelligent Time enabled. If you’re subscribed only to Time (and Expenses), these fields remain on the Configure Time page.

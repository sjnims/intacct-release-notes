# The Help Center now opens in a new browser tab

[Find answers and get the most out of help](https://preview.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Help_availability_overview)

User Experience

When you launch help in Sage Intacct, it now opens in a new browser tab right next to your Sage Intacct tab.

## What's changed

Previously, Sage Intacct help opened in a small, limited-function browser window. Now when you select **Help on this page** or **Help Center** from the **Help & Support** menu, help opens in a full browser tab. This behavior aligns with modern web standards and user expectations for help content delivery.

## Key Benefits

- **Consistent navigation**: Use standard browser navigation (Back/Forward buttons) without limitations.
- **Save and share**: Bookmark articles, copy links, and revisit topics anytime.
- **More accessible**: Get faster access to screen readers and other browser extensions.

**Bonus**: We also redesigned the Help Center welcome page to include intuitive categories and quick links to popular videos and topics, making it faster to find answers and reducing the time spent searching for resources.

If you miss having help in a separate window, simply right-click on the help tab and select **Move tab to new window**.

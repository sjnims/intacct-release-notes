# The Allowed email addresses list

[Manage the allowed email list](https://preview.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Company_Allowed_email_list)

company and Administration

The Allowed email addresses list helps protect your organization from email spoofing and phishing attacks. The list helps you ensure that all emails sent from Sage Intacct to your customers come from trusted, verified addresses.

The Allowed email list is automatically populated with the distinct Sender and Reply-To email addresses used by your company over the past three months.

This change improves email security and helps ensure emails sent from Sage Intacct use trusted, approved addresses.

## Good to know

- The allowed email list is available for review and management by company administrators.
- Admins can add, remove, or keep existing entries based on the needs of the company.
- The allowed email list does not change any current email behavior.

## Next steps

Sage Intacct recommends you review the allowed email list.

1. Log in as an administrator and go to **Company > Setup**.
2. Under Configuration, select **Company** and then the **Security** tab.
3. Review the emails listed in the **Allowed email addresses** section.

To make changes to the list, select **Edit** on the Security tab and edit the list as needed.

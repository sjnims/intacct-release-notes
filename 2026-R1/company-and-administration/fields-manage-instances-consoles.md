# Improved Manage instances view—Consoles

[Manage instances list —Consoles](https://preview.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Manage_instances_list)

Consoles

We added and removed fields from the Manage instances list to make it easier to organize, view, and manage your companies. Key company details in one place with clear and consistent fields across your instances.

## What's changed

-   **Simplified fields**: We removed the Entity ID and Entity Company fields. Find this information in the Instance ID field and Company name field.
-   **New Type column**: View the instance type to help distinguish between company types.

## How it works

To view the manage instances list, go to **My practice** or **Console** > **Instances**.

Cash Management

Experience a simpler way to manage check printing settings for your company address and logo.

Your check printing setup is now simpler and more intuitive. With clearer options for addresses and logos, you can format checks the way you want without seeing unnecessary fields

## Key benefits

The changes we made make it easier to set up the following check printing settings:

- Include an address that's different than the address in the Company information page.
- Upload a company logo to print on checks.

## What's changed

1.  The fields for entering a different company address on checks are now only visible when you select the option to use a different address than the address on the Company information page.
2.  The controls for printing a logo have moved and are now next to the option for printing a company address on your checks.

## How it works

On the Check printing tab of the checking account issuing the checks, do the following:

1.  To print a company address on checks, select **Print company address**.

    When you select **Print company address**, the Company address section appears.

2.  In the Company address section, select **Use a different address**.

    When you select **Use a different address**, the address entry fields appear where you can enter the address details to add an address that's different than the address on the Company information page.

3.  To print a logo, select **Print logo**.

    The Company logo section appears.

Cash Management

When you import data using Bank transaction assistant, the transactions now appear on the Banking cloud tab of your account, the same as bank feed data. This means that transactions from that import can be consistently managed similar to the bank feed data.

## How it works

1.  Use the Bank transaction assistant to [import your bank file](https://dev-us.intacct.com/users/ia-help/helpfiles_prod/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Import_bank_transactions).
2.  [Create an assignment rule](https://dev-us.intacct.com/users/ia-help/helpfiles_prod/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Create_assignment_rule) to assign the imported file to the appropriate account.
3.  [Reconcile the account](https://dev-us.intacct.com/users/ia-help/helpfiles_prod/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Bank_rec_overview).

# Streamlined tax totals in converted transactions

This idea came from you

Order Entry and Purchasing transactions with VAT and GST now display net and tax in a single line when you convert them to Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable transactions. Custom tax reports also show net and tax in the same line. This change provides a clearer view for transaction details and aligns the experience with direct AP/AR postings.

## Key benefits

-   **Clearer transaction details**: No separate lines for net and tax, everything is in one place.
    
-   **Improved reporting**: Custom tax reports now also show net and tax in the same line.
    
-   **Consistent experience**: Matches the behavior of direct AP/AR postings and cash basis tax capture in France.
    
-   **Global rollout**: Previously available only in France; now extended to all regions and transaction types.

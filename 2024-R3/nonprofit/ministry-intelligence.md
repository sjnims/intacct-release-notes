# Enhancements in Sage Intacct Ministry Intelligence

[About Sage Intacct Ministry Intelligence](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=ministry_intelligence)

NONPROFIT

Ministry Intelligence seamlessly connects accounting and business operations by delivering key church management data and visibility into KPIs and insights critical to strengthening congregation health.

We've recently made Ministry Intelligence even better with the following enhancements.

-   Automatically distinguish one-time gifts from recurring contributions, so that one-time gifts do not cause fluctuations in your sustaining giving metrics.
    
    For example, a donor gives $50 every month to the General Fund. One month, they give $1,000 to the General Fund, and the next month they return to the consistent $50 gift. The $1,000 donation will be flagged as an outlier and considered a one-time gift.
    
    With this feature, expect more gifts to be recorded as one-time, but less movement in important sustaining giving metrics like monthly sustaining giving (MSG).
    
-   You'll now get only one email informing you of the results of processing (previously, you could receive multiple emails). Also, this single email provides more useful information, including the following:
    -   Number of successful givers
    -   List of failed givers with information explaining why they failed
    -   Start time and end time of processing
-   Integrate Ministry Intelligence with Rock RMS. When you sync, new givers, transactions, and bank deposits are created automatically. Information from these transactions is used in your giving dashboards.
    
    To integrate with Rock RMS, open the Ministry Connect configuration (**Ministry Connect** > **Config** from the application switcher) and then select Rock RMS from the **ChMS Platform** dropdown.

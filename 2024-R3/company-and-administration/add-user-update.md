# Apply user permissions and roles more quickly

[Add a user](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Add_a_user)

Company AND ADMINISTRATION

We've streamlined how you apply permissions and roles when you add a new user.

Previously, user permission information was spread across multiple tabs. To improve clarity and ease of use, we've consolidated user permission settings onto a single page. This means you can now manage user permissions in one convenient location.

- If your company is configured for user-based permissions, you will see the new **Sage Intacct Financials permissions** section where you can assign a User type and Admin privileges to the user.
- If your company is configured for role-based permissions, the **Roles** table will appear where you can assign one or more user roles to the user.

## How it works

1.  Go to **Company > **Admin\***\* > **Users, roles, and groups** and select Add beside **Users\*\*.
2.  Select a **User type** and **Admin privileges**.
3.  If your company is configured for role-based permissions, select Add in the Roles table to assign a user role to the user.  
    Repeat to add more than one user role.
4.  Select **Save**.

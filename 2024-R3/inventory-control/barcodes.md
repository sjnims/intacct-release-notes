# Barcodes added in Sage Intacct Inventory Automation

[Sage Intacct Inventory Automation](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=inventory-automation)

INVENTORY CONTROL

If you have Sage Intacct Inventory Automation, you can make inventory tasks faster and easier by including barcodes on inventory forms. For example:

-   Including a barcode on a purchase order lets you use it as a receiver document.
-   Including a barcode on a picking sheet can speed up sales order picking.

To include barcodes, you use barcode fonts. [Learn more about barcode fonts.](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2024/2024_Release_3/Platform_Services/2024-R3-fonts-for-printed-doc-templates.htm)

We're rolling out these enhancements to all customers on all of our lists in upcoming releases.

## Try it on the Vendors list

1. Go to **Accounts Payable** > **All tab** > **Vendors**.
2. Select **Turn on Lists beta interface**.

    The page refreshes to display the enhanced list.

Be sure to select **Send us feedback** during this beta so that we can get your input on what works and what you think could be improved.

## Personalize your list views

Customize your list views while you work:

- Add, move, and resize columns
- Freeze columns on the screen to preserve the view when scrolling
- Sort columns by the data that means the most to you
- Save your customized views for future use

When you enable enhanced lists, all current public views and your current private views are automatically migrated to the enhanced views for that list.

[Example](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2024/2024_Release_3/User_Experience/2024-R3-next-gen-lists.htm#)

If you want to view payment priority and term on the Vendors list, you can add the **Payment priority** column and the **Term** column to the list view. If you want both columns to appear before or after other columns, you can drag them to the desired location on the list. You could then sort the **Payment priority** column to view the priority for payment from the most urgent to least urgent.

After you have the desired filters, sort, and display settings, save the view with a unique name for future use.

## Refine your results with advanced filters

With advanced filtering, you can easily narrow down your data. Advanced filtering works across columns and you can even save what you filter on into a custom view for repeated use.

Some examples of advanced filtering:

- Search for a range on date and amount fields
- Combine multiple filter criteria using AND and OR operators

## View record details next to your list

Easily navigate the list records while viewing the record details side-by-side in a split view mode.

## Even more enhancements

The Lists enhancements have even more features, including:

- Bulk operations
- Improved organization and central management of list views
- More colors for displaying your hierarchy

## Permissions and other requirements

# Quickly delete unneeded reporting periods

[Delete a reporting period](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Delete_rpt_pds)

general ledger

On the Reporting period list, we replaced the individual Delete links with checkboxes and added a Delete button at the top of the list. Save time by selecting multiple reporting periods and deleting all of them at once.

You cannot delete a reporting period if transactions have been posted for the period or if budget data exists for the period.

## How it works

1. Go to **General Ledger** > **Setup** > **Reporting periods**.
2. In the **Delete** column, select the checkbox for one or more reporting periods.

    Use the filters to identify the periods that need to be deleted.

3. Select the **Delete** button above the grid.

# Enhancements in EMRConnect

EMRConnect works with most delimited flat files that are exported from EMR systems. You can set up field mappings for as many formats as you need.

We've recently made EMRConnect even better with the following enhancements.

- Set up multiple email addresses to receive email notifications from Intacct about whether batches were successful.
- Choose whether or not to automatically summarize GL entries.
- Entries that include single-digit dates can now be processed.
- Email notifications now warn you if the General Ledger is unbalanced.

For more information about subscribing, talk to your [Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

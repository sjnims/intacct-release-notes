# Enhancements in Sage Field Operations

[About Sage Field Operations](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=sage-field-operations)

CONSTRUCTION

Sage Field Operations syncs seamlessly with Sage Intacct whether you're in the office or in the field. Office staff have to-the-minute information for scheduling. And the mobile app provides your team in the field with the critical information that they need, when they need it.

For more information, talk to your [Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

We've recently made Sage Field Operations even better with enhancements for the office.

-   If your company uses Inventory Control, Sage Field Operations users can now use serialized inventory.
    -   When adding inventory items to work orders, users can select a serial number from those available in Sage Intacct, specific to the part and warehouse.
    -   Users can create serialized parts that synchronize with Sage Intacct, ensuring accurate integrated inventory management.
-   If you use Fortis payments with Sage Field Operations, enhancements help you settle your invoices more promptly.
    -   Include click-to-pay URLs in invoices and invoice emails.
    -   Process credit card payments through the Sage Field Operations Customer Portal.
-   Ensure that union payroll is processed accurately and in compliance with union requirements.
    
    Union, local, and class details associated with employee labor are now captured and seamlessly integrated with Sage Intacct Time and Expenses.

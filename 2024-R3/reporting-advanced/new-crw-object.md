ADVANCED REPORTING

You can now add Joint Payee name and Joint Payee print fields to your Construction Custom Report Writer (CRW) reports.

Now when you create joint checks, Joint Payee print allows you to create a CRW report that shows the check payee print as information within the report. Likewise, Joint Payee name (for which the check was created) allows you to track joint checks and the payee names.

## How it works

Custom Report Writer (CRW) reports provide enhanced insights to your company data. Custom reports and dimension structures are based on individual records and fields that can also be grouped together.

The Custom Report Wizard is a CRW utility that walks you through creating a report that is tailored to your needs. For more information, see [Add or edit a custom report--CRW](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Adding_and_editing_custom_reports).

ADVANCED REPORTING

New reporting areas are now available for Interactive Custom Report Writer (ICRW) and Interactive Visual Explorer (IVE).

- A new **Assets** reporting area for the Asset dimension with Fixed Assets Management.
- A new **Depreciation Schedule** reporting area to track depreciation schedule entries and related fields with Fixed Assets Management.
- A new **Depreciation Schedule Detail** reporting area provides a Depreciation Schedule header for Fixed Assets Management.

ICRW and IVE require separate subscriptions. To purchase or enable ICRW and IVE subscriptions, [contact your Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

## How it works

One of the first things you do when you create an ICRW report or IVE visualization, is to select a reporting area. A reporting area correlates data objects that provide specialized options. You can select the options you want to include in your report or visualization, customizing it to your needs.

1. Review the [Reporting areas reference](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=ICRW_reporting_area_reference) for descriptions of available reporting areas to determine which one provides the data best suited for your report.
2. Follow the instructions in [Selecting a reporting area](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Select_subject_area) for ICRW or [Create visualizations in IVE](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=IVE_new_visualizations).

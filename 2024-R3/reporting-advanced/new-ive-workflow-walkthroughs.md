ADVANCED REPORTING

Interactive Visual Explorer (IVE) enables you to explore data with visualizations that illustrate your data's story. The workflow walk-through examples are step-by-step guides for using calculations, filters, and applying different visualizations to analyze data from different perspectives. This capability allows you to fully explore correlations and patterns, and discover trends.

IVE requires a separate subscription. To purchase or enable an IVE subscription, [contact your Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

-   **Workflow 5: Projects sales order performance** shows you how to create a project that allows you to explore and analyze trends in company transactions across Projects and Tasks.

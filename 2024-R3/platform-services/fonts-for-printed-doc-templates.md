We're excited to announce the addition of new fonts available on our servers for use in printed document Microsoft Word templates.

These new fonts include:

- Libre Barcode 39 Extended
- Libre Barcode 128
- Cordia New

## Details

### Libre Barcode Fonts

The Libre Barcode 39 Extended and Libre Barcode 128 fonts are designed for creating barcodes, which can be useful for inventory management, product labeling, and tracking systems.

- **Libre Barcode 39 Extended:** This font allows for encoding uppercase letters, numbers, and some special characters, making it a versatile option for barcode applications.
- **Libre Barcode 128:** Known for its high-density encoding, this font supports a wide range of characters, including ASCII. The supported characters make this font ideal for compact barcode representations in applications such as shipping labels and retail product tracking.

The Libre barcode fonts are Google fonts.

### Cordia New

The Cordia New font has been added to support the Thai language, ensuring that documents requiring Thai script can be accurately and elegantly formatted.

This font is widely used in Thailand and is known for its readability and clear presentation of Thai characters. It is especially useful for documents that need to include Thai text, such as official documents and business communications.

[Cordia New font is a Microsoft font](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/cordia-new) (microsoft.com).This font is supported by the latest version of Windows.

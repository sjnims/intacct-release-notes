# Include advanced reports in application packages

[Provide application access with menus](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Application_menus)

platform services

With this release, we continue to give you more flexibility and options. Now you have another way to add Interactive Visual Explorer and Interactive Custom Reports to an application so that you can include them in your package.

## Details

When you define a Platform application menu, you can select reports for your menu type. Now you can also add additional advanced reports to your application from the application page. Adding reports directly from the application page streamlines your application creation process and allows you to include the reports in your application package. You can continue to add reports from menus as well.

## How it works

1. Go to **Platform Services > Platform tools,** and select **Applications**.
2. Select the application to which you want to add the report.
3. From the shortcuts in the component lists, select **Reports**.
4. Next to Reports select **Add existing reports**.
5. Use **Select** to choose your reports.

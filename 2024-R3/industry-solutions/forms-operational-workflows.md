# Enhancements in Sage Intacct Forms and Operational Workflows

Simplify onboarding and streamline interactions with new onboarding workflow and client portals.

-   **Client onboarding**: Workflows to share contractual documents and speed up the onboarding process. Set up for success, foster engagement, and enhance overall satisfaction.
-   **Client portal**: Customizable portal with streamlined interactions on account changes, answering questions, feedback forms, and more.
-   **Vendor contracting**: Use CharityAPI.org to check if a vendor is a 501(c) registered nonprofit organization.

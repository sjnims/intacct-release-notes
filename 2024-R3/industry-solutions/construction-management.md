## Details

In this release we've made several enhancements to Sage Construction Management.

### Storage upgrade to 1 terabyte

Sage Construction Management Individual or Max Employee Plans now include 1 terabyte (TB) of storage at no additional cost.

### Improved filtering for user projects and leads

A new classification filter in the **Active Leads & Projects** page allows administrators to filter the projects or leads of a specific user by type and code.

### Improved submittal of item dates

Date fields automatically display the review dates according to the set number of days.

In the **Item Dates - Material Required On Site and Design Review** section, you can now set the **Review dates** based on the **Required On Site date** and the number of days for the following:

- **Lead Time:** Sets the date reflected through the **Review - Return to Originator** field.
- **Design Review Time:** Sets the date in the **Review - Completion Date** field.
- **Internal Review Time:** Sets the date in the **Review - Submission Date** field.

### Other enhancements

- In some selection lists in Company Settings, you can now select **None** to require users to enter record numbers.
- Accounting Link improvements:
  - With new posting preferences in Contact Management, you can set Customer ID Numbering and Vendor ID Numbering to use the Intacct Doc Sequence by default.
  - Use the Company code from Sage Intacct in Sage Construction Management.
  - The Sage Intacct connection information has been moved to the top left.
  - Vendor IDs and customer IDs from Sage 100 Contractor and Sage 300 CRE are now automatically entered in Sage Construction Management when you import, automatically link, or synchronize.

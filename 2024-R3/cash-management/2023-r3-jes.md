# Increased efficiency for journal entries created during reconciliation

Save more time when you create journal entries from bank transactions during reconciliation. Now, the exchange rate date defaults to the bank transaction date for improved accuracy. Previously, if this date was required, it defaulted to today's date.

## How it works

1. Go to **Cash Management > All > Reconciliation > Bank** or **Credit card**.
2. Select the **Account to reconcile** and enter the statement information.
3. Go to the **Bank** tab.
4. For the bank transaction, select **Action** and then select **Journal entry**.
5. The **Posting date** for the journal entry defaults to the date of the bank transaction.

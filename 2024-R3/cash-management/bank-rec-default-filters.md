# View all unmatched transactions immediately during reconciliation

We changed your default view on the Reconcile account pages! When you open the Reconcile bank account page or the Reconcile credit card account page, the Transaction type filter now defaults to All, revealing all your unmatched transactions for easy viewing and management. Previously, the default filter only showed unmatched checks and debits.

## How it works

Go to **Cash Management** > **All** > **Reconcile** > **Bank** or **Credit card**.

All unmatched transactions appear for matching.

Time and Expenses

We've redesigned the approvals page to enhance your experience, aligning it more closely with typical workflows in Intacct. Additionally, we've introduced a new page for approving time entries by project, customer, or task.

## Details

Approvers can now choose between two pages: Approve Timesheets or Approve Time Entries.

### Approve Timesheets page

The Approve Timesheets page is best suited for managers that need to review their employee's timesheets.

- Each row in the table is a timesheet.
- Users can filter and sort by employee or other details.
- Users can approve or decline timesheets in bulk, or open a timesheet to approve or decline specific entries.

### Approve Time Entries page

The Approve Time Entries page is best suited for project managers that need to review all time entries tagged to a certain customer, project, or task dimension.

- Each row in the table is a time entry.
- Users can filter and sort by customer, project, task, or other details.
- Users can approve or decline time entries in bulk across different employees.

## How it works

You can approve or decline timesheets or time entries.

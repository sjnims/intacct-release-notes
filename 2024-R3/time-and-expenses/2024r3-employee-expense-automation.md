# Automate your employee expenses—Early adopter

We are excited to announce a new automated worflow for submitting your employee expenses. Save time and ensure accuracy by emailing your employee expense receipts from any device directly to Sage Intacct.

Your employees can now email their travel or other receipts and use artificial intelligence (AI) to assist in coding them. Machine learning (ML) remembers the changes for future receipts, making the whole employee expense report process even easier.

You can get a sneak peek at what's coming by joining our Early Adopter program.

## Example

## How it works

1.  Your employees email their receipts to a Sage Intacct email.  
    AI technology populates the receipts with data.
2.  Then, the employee updates their receipts with more details or additional coding.
3.  When your employee creates their expense report, they can easily pull in all those receipts.

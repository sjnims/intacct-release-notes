Time and Expenses

An audit trail is now available for timesheets in Sage Intelligent Time. You can access it on the My Timesheets and Staff Timesheets pages. Viewing the audit trail opens the Intacct audit trail in a popup window.

This feature is only available in the embedded version of Sage Intelligent Time.

## How it works

1.  Go to one of the following in Sage Intacct:
    
    -   **Time and Expenses** > **All** > **My timesheets** or **Staff timesheets**.
        
    -   **Projects** > **All** > **My timesheets** or **Staff timesheets**.
        
2.  Find a timesheet in the list.
3.  On the right side of the table row, select ![](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/Resources/Images/2024/2024-R2-images/2024-R2-SIT-timesheet-line-control.png) > **View audit trail**.
    
    Alternatively, open the timesheet and select **View audit trail** at the top right of the page.

# Recall timesheets—Sage Intelligent Time

[Recall a timesheet](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=IT_recall_timesheet)

Time and Expenses

You can now recall timesheets to correct mistakes quickly without needing to involve your manager or wait for the timesheet to be declined first. Simply recall your timesheet from the Submitted status, make any necessary corrections, and then resubmit it for approval.

## Details

- Only timesheets in the Submitted status can be recalled.
- Recall is only available on the My Timesheets page.
- When a timesheet is recalled, it returns to the Draft status and is removed from the approver's list.

## How it works

1. Go to one of the following in Sage Intacct:
    - **Time and Expenses** > **All** > **My timesheets**.
    - **Projects** > **All** > **My timesheets**.

    Or, log in to Sage Intelligent Time and go to **My timesheets**.

2. Find a timesheet in the list that's in the **Submitted** state.
3. Select ![](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/Resources/Images/2024/2024-R2-images/2024-R2-SIT-timesheet-line-control.png)\> **Recall**.

    Alternatively, open the timesheet and select **Recall** at the top right of the page.

    The timesheet reverts to the Draft status. You can edit and resubmit it for approval.

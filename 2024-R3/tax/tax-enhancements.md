# Updates and enhancements for taxes

[Update a standard VAT or GST setup](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Update_standard_setup)

Taxes

To comply with changing tax requirements in the countries we support, we made several updates and enhancements to our existing standard tax solutions. You can review the tax setup change log and update the TVA Française standard tax solution with the newest setup changes.

## Tax solution updates

We added Deutsche Umsatzsteuer as the standard tax solution for Germany, and we made updates to the following tax solutions:

### TVA Française

-   Added additional use cases to include purchase and sales from EU and ROW.
    

### United Kingdom VAT

-   Clarified changes in how reverse charge is reported. Users are required to include both input and output tax details for a reverse charge. Without both, the transaction will not be reported in all the correct boxes.
    
-   Updated the following reverse charge tax details to calculate the tax:
    
    -   UK PVA Import Goods Standard Rate Input
        
    -   UK PVA Import Goods Standard Rate Output
        
    -   UK PVA Import Goods Reduced Rate Input
        
    -   UK PVA Import Goods Reduced Rate Output

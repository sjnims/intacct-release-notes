# Search help with Copilot—Early Adopter

Introducing the Early Adopter release of our new semantic search engine, designed to revolutionize the way you find help and answers within Sage Intacct. Copilot understands the context and intent behind your queries, providing more accurate and relevant results. While it's still in its early phases, we're offering a limited number of users a chance to check out this innovative solution.

## AI-powered search

Semantic search offers the following benefits:

-   **Natural language understanding**: Copilot understands the nuances of Sage Intacct terminology and can interpret complex queries.
-   **Increased efficiency**: Significantly reduces search time and the need for multiple searches by delivering more relevant results.
    
-   **Intelligent recommendations**: Provides suggestions for related topics and articles to expand your knowledge.

## How it works

When your company is enabled to use Search help with Copilot, you'll see a new **Search help** option in the **Help & Support** menu.

Selecting **Search help** opens the Copilot panel on the right side of your Intacct page.

Enter a query using natural language in the search box located at the bottom of the **Search help** panel. The more specific you are, the more accurate the results will be.

Copilot responds with an answer and provides links to additional information.

## What's the Early Adopter program?

The Early Adopter program allows a select group of customers to test and provide feedback on new features. Their input will help us refine and improve these features before the general release.

The Early Adopter program is actively monitored. We work closely with the early adopters to ensure that we focus our time and attention on what matters most to you.

Sage Intacct Payroll powered by ADP is the only full-service payroll and human capital management (HCM) suite that works seamlessly with Sage Intacct.

## Streamlined integration

We've streamlined the integration between Sage Intacct Payroll and Sage Intacct. You no longer need to log in to a separate application to manage the integration—everything is now included in Sage Intacct Payroll.

So you can push entries to Intacct and pull information, such as timesheets, directly from Sage Intacct Payroll.

# Improved syncing with Sage Intacct PSA

PROJECTS & Grants

We've improved syncing of data between Sage Intacct and Sage Intacct PSA (Professional Services Automation).

Changes to projects and tasks are synced in real time, so that data for these records is always the same in both Intacct and PSA.

For more information about Sage Intacct PSA, talk to your [Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

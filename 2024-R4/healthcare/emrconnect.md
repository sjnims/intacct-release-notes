# Enhancements in EMRConnect

EMRConnect works with most delimited flat files that are exported from EMR (electronic medical records) systems. You can set up field mappings for as many formats as you need.

We've recently made EMRConnect even better with the following enhancements.

- Bring data into Sage Intacct from source fields that contain larger amounts of characters.
- When you send files to an SFTP (secure file transfer protocol) site, statistical and general ledger data is parsed automatically. You no longer need to download the file and save it with two separate names before sending it to SFTP.
- Users can now identify user-defined dimensions.
- You can now set the last day of the month to be the default batch date.
- Provider file can be set up during installation to make implementation faster.
- Finding out if there are missing files is now faster, because blank files no longer produce errors. Blank files are often produced to show that a batch job or report extract ran with no results.
- When creating a general ledger batch, missing dimension values are shown.

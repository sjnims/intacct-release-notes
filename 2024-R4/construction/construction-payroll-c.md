# Enhancements in Sage Intacct Construction Payroll

Sage Intacct Construction Payroll handles construction payroll complexities not found in general payroll solutions. This solution provides a complete view of your project costs with unprecedented visibility into each cost component.

For more information, talk to your [Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

We're excited to share the latest features added in Sage Intacct Construction Payroll. The improvements include the following enhancements.

- An upgraded import utility includes the following new features:
  - Enhanced validation routines prevent invalid data within the payroll system.
  - The selection process for field mapping is simpler.
  - Drag and drop import files.
  - Validate import data more easily using a split screen.
  - Delete rows during import, or download the records if changes have been made during the import process.
  - Where available, an import field can include multiple values in the same field.

- On the Checks page, check generation is now faster. For pay groups with a large number of employees, processing times have been reduced to as little as 25% of their previous duration.
- When created using the standard check stub generation process, check stubs include the employer address, and 401(k) split into pre-tax and post-tax amounts. Also, a combined single printable check/advice notice PDF is no longer generated.
- We've enhanced the check modification process so you can do the following:
  - Override pay modifiers that are associated with multiple distributions on the same work date.
  - Prevent removal of pay modifier overrides during the recalculation process.

# Add the scope and schedule to a project

You can add the scope and schedule to a project so that everyone involved in the project is aware of those important details and stays on schedule.

We've added a new Scope and schedule section on the Project tab of the Project information page where you can define the scope, exclusions, inclusions, and terms. Add various start and completion dates in the Schedule section.

# Enhancements in Sage Field Operations

[About Sage Field Operations](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=sage-field-operations)

CONSTRUCTION

Sage Field Operations syncs seamlessly with Sage Intacct whether you're in the office or in the field. Office staff have to-the-minute information for scheduling. And the mobile app provides your team in the field with the critical information that they need, when they need it.

For more information, talk to your [Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

We've recently made Sage Field Operations even better with enhancements for business intelligence and serialized inventory. Also, there's a new app for mobile devices.

    -   Transform complex data into actionable information.
    -   Proactively improve utilization and reduce margin loss with precise and detailed business monitoring.
    -   See risks earlier to steer your team toward success.
    -   Drive efficiency with deep insights into business health, profit opportunities, and productivity—all while collecting information from the field.
    -   Understand and manage challenges with labor capacity.

    -   Put the power of data behind your business's future.

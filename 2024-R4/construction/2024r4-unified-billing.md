# Print time and materials and expense billing details for project contract invoices

You can now print time and materials and expenses billing details directly from project contract invoices, without creating a separate report. These billed expenses appear together for streamlined reporting and use on printed invoices.

You can then sort, filter, and group all billed expenses, with links for easy navigation to review the original cost entry.

A new configuration option also allows you to zip all supporting documents automatically and attach to customer invoices when you send an email.

## Details

The **Summary billing details** tab on Order Entry invoices now includes all time and materials and expense transactions for that invoice.

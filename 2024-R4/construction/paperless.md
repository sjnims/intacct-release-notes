# Improvements for invoices in Sage Intacct Paperless

We've improved how you work with invoices.

On the Invoice Entry page (**APFlow** > **Invoice Entry**):

-   The 'pop out' document page now automatically updates to show the document that's currently selected.
-   Invoice descriptions have been added.
-   Route templates have been added to the Route page, giving you the option to either create a custom approval route from scratch or build one using a template.

On the Approve Invoice page (**APFlow** > **Approve Invoice**), the 'pop out' document page now automatically updates to show the document that's currently selected.

Paperless OCR (optical character recognition) is now available for Sage Intacct Paperless. Smart OCR and AI work together to identify key invoice data and make invoice entry and coding as efficient as possible.

For more information, see the [Sage Paperless for Construction web page](https://www.sage.com/en-us/products/sage-paperless-construction/) or talk to your [Sage Intacct account manager](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contact_your_account_manager).

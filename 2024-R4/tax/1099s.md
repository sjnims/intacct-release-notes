Stay a step ahead and get ready for the 1099 season. We've gathered the following resources for you to help you through the process:

-   [How to run the 1099 report](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Reports_1099).
    
-   [How to verify that your vendors are set up correctly](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Form_1099_Information_w_YTD) and that taxable amounts are as expected.
    

If you have 10 or more forms to file, the IRS requires that you file electronically. Read our article about how to [e-file your 1099s with Sage Intacct and TaxBandits](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=TOC_efile_TaxBandits).

If you only have a few forms to submit, you can [print forms](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Form_1099). Make sure to [order tax forms](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Order_1099_forms) from our supported vendor to guarantee correct printing alignment.

## Form changes

All 1099 forms now support a 2 digit calendar year instead of 4. And, Forms 1099-DIV, 1099-G, 1099-INT, 1099-K, 1099-MISC, and 1099-NEC no longer include Copy C, but instead print Copy 1 and Copy 2.

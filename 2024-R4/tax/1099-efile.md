Tax

Skip the manual printing of 1099 forms and send tax information directly to our trusted partner, TaxBandits, which is authorized by the IRS as a 1099 e-filing provider.

From TaxBandits, you can also file state forms, send forms by postal mail, and grant online access to recipients.

If you have 10 or more 1099 forms to file, the IRS requires that you file electronically.

## Workflow

The process of creating and filing batches of 1099 forms is easy, thanks to tight integration between Sage Intacct and TaxBandits.

Create a batch for a range of vendors or a batch of a type of form, such as 1099-MISC. Then, with the click of a button, send the batch of files to TaxBandits where you continue the e-filing process. You can create and send multiple batches to TaxBandits.

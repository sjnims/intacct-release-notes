## New language options for Canadian French and Spanish—Beta

You can now set your preferred language to Canadian French or Spanish. The new language options are available in both the Company preferences page and User preferences page.

This is an open beta. Some elements might not be fully translated.

## Details

Setting the language preference at the Company level changes the language for all the users in your company. Setting the language preference at the User level changes the language just for that user.

You can change your company or personal language settings to the following options:

-   English (Australia)
    
-   English (United States)
    
-   English (United Kingdom)
    
-   English (South Africa)
    
-   French (France)
    
-   French (Canada) - Beta
    
-   German (Germany)
    
-   Spanish (Spain) - Beta
    

When you set your Intacct local language, the following areas appear in your preferred language:

-   Sage Intacct UI
    
-   Help Center
    
-   Community
    
-   Release notes
    

However, the following will not be in your preferred language:

-   Custom terminology
    
-   User data
    
-   Platform apps
    
-   Marketplace apps
    

You can enable preferred language in Custom terminology through Platform Services. [Learn more about language options for custom labels](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2024/2024_Release_4/Platform_Services/2024-R4-platform-i18n-labels.htm).

# Customer ID added to Company information page

[Company information](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Company_information)

Company and administration

You no longer have to hunt through old emails for your Sage Intacct customer ID. For example, you need your customer ID to create an account for the Sage Intacct Community or Sage University. You can now find the ID on the Company information page.

## Details

To see your customer ID, go to **Company** \> **Setup** \> **Configuration** \> **Company**.

When we made this change, we also changed the label for the original ID field to Company ID.

Every company has a customer ID. The ID represents the organization of whomever signed the contract to purchase Sage Intacct. That could be your organization, or it could be your Sage business partner's, depending on how Intacct was purchased.

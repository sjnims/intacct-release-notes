# Announcing AP Automation for Germany

[Automate bill entry](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=TOC_ap_bill_automation)

Accounts Payable

We're excited to announce that AP Automation is now generally available for Germany. Previously, AP Automation was available only to Early Adopters in Germany, while generally available for all other regions.

## Details

AP  Automation, an add-on feature to Accounts Payable, streamlines your data entry process to save you time and money. Intacct automatically creates draft bills from bill documents that you email or upload to Sage Intacct. Bill details are automatically populated for you, using data from the original document and the vendor information record.

All that's left for you to do is to review the drafted bills, make any coding changes or adjustments, and either submit for approval or post them. Intacct informs you of any issues that it detects, such as a duplicate bill submission, lack of a vendor match, or a problem with the file format. You can correct these issues before you post.

To use this feature, talk to your account manager or Channel Executive for more information.

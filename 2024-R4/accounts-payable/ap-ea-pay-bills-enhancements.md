# Pay bills enhancements—Early adopter

[Pay bills](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=TOC_ap_workbench)

Accounts payable

Looking for higher capacity bill processing, easier ways to drill down to credits, and the ability to sort and filter columns? Our latest enhancements to Pay bills offer these improvements to early adopters.

These enhancements are useful if you do any of the following:

-   Regularly process over 1000 bills to a single vendor and merge payments in the Outbox to combine them
-   Selectively apply vendor credits to payments, searching through many available credits
-   Want to refine the list of bills to pay on the fly

## Details

From the main Pay bills page, you can now do the following:

1.  Load up to 5,000 bills in Pay bills at one time
    
2.  Sort and filter the list of bills by Bill number, Bill date, and Due date.
    
3.  Drill down to credit details by selecting the Credit amount value for a bill, in the list of bills to pay.
    

Sorting and filtering works on all bills loaded into Pay bills, not just the bills visible on the current screen.

In the Apply credit screen, sort and filter the list of credits by Credit type, Reference number, Line no., Credit date, Account, Department, Location, and Reference bill number.

In the Bill details screen, filter by Account, Department, Location, Currency, Amount due, Credits available, Credits to apply, Discounts, and Amount to pay.

## What is the Early adopter program?

The Early adopter program provides the new Pay bills enhancements to Accounts Payable users who process high volumes of bills. As an early adopter, you can influence how we develop the product so that our product meets your business needs.

The Early adopter program participants work closely with Sage Intacct product managers to ensure we focus on what matters most. Early adopter participants are expected to periodically respond to surveys and provide input.

If your company regularly processes large volumes of bills at one time, we encourage you to [sign up today](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=fN0yPvZBLUmho8WOsCz0-Lg9xrjR-UxFvIqp7-KsdE1UQUhBWUEzRVFDMUNIRks3UDJMOTZGVTNTMC4u&route=shorturl).

# Upcoming change to document ID requirement—launching in 2025

To align with upcoming automation requirements and ensure consistency across applications, Sage Intacct will permit users to save draft purchase transactions without a document ID. This change will ensure more efficiency in completing your transaction workflows, and provide more flexibility during transaction processing.

## Benefits

By relaxing the document ID requirement in draft transactions, you'll be able to leverage additional document tracking options:

- Save transactions in draft state when you are not sure of the document ID.
- Automatically assign draft transactions the next sequence number. To avoid any confusion, the document number field is not visible until the draft is saved.

After a numbering sequence is assigned to a draft document, it cannot be changed.

- If you convert transactions that automatically use the source document number, you can change or delete the number when saving as a draft.

## How it works

When entering new transactions, purchasing clerks will be able to improve their efficiency by entering purchase transactions with less required information.

Additionally, accounting managers will have greater flexibility in information gathering prior to posting: Easier parent document identification quickly track transactions using source document number retrieval, or merge several purchase orders into one invoice and update the draft later.

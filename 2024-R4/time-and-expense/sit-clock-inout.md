# Track time quickly and accurately with time clocks—Sage Intelligent Time

Achieve precise time tracking and compliance with ease using Intelligent Time time clocks.

Employees can clock in and out of different projects or tasks multiple times during the day. When you clock in and out, those time clock entries are pulled into a summarized timesheet that you can submit for approval.

You can also clock in and out of projects or tasks using the mobile app.

## Details

Time clocks accurately record when you clock in and out, including breaks, ensuring precise timekeeping. They help maintain compliance with labor laws by keeping detailed records of hours worked and mandatory breaks for all employees.

You can use time clocks for the following:

- Payroll processing
- Billing customers
- Use Project generate invoices (PGI) for projects

## Before you begin

- When you clock in for the first time, a timesheet is created automatically and includes entries from your time clock.
- You cannot have 2 active time clocks at the same time. You can only be clocked in to 1 project or task at a time.
- The fields that you track time by appear depending on your application configuration.

  For more information, go to [Select fields to track time by to appear on time clocks.](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=IT_select_fields_to_track_time_by)

- If you work overnight, the hours of each day are captured on your timesheet.

  For example, your shift starts at 8 p.m and ends at 4 a.m. On your timesheet, the entries show that you worked 4 hours each on those specific days, completing your 8 hour shift.

Users with Staff timesheets permissions can edit and delete time clocks, and they can clock in and out employees of a project or task.

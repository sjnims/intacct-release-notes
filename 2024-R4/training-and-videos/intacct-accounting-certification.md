# Announcing the first customer certification for Sage Intacct

Are you a Sage Intacct accounting expert?

The Sage Intacct Accounting Specialist Certification is open to customers who perform financial transactions and generate reports using Intacct. The certification exam assesses your knowledge of Sage Intacct and the skills outlined in the certification guide.

We highly recommend completing the Sage Intacct Fundamentals course before taking the certification assessment.

After passing the exam, you'll receive a certificate and a badge. You can add these to your email signature, LinkedIn profile, and other platforms to enhance your professional brand and showcase your skills.

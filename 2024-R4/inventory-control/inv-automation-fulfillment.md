# Fulfillment and Sage Intacct Inventory Automation

[Sage Intacct Inventory Automation](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=inventory-automation)

INVENTORY CONTROL

Sage Intacct Inventory Automation now integrates with Fulfillment, so you can have a true multi-step order fulfillment process with barcode scanning.

-   Use the pick, pack, and ship processes in Fulfillment.
-   You can use all of the steps separately, or keep it as simple as a single step process.
-   Automatically print carrier labels (UPS, FedEx, USPS) from mobile scanners during your packing/shipping step.

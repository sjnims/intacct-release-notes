# Updates to the Manage Revenue Schedules page

[Manage revenue schedules](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Manage_revenue_recognition_schedules)

Revenue Management

We made the following updates on the Manage Revenue Schedules page to improve your experience.

## New selection options

We expanded the selection options on the Manage Revenue Schedules page allowing you to select large numbers of rows efficiently. Now you can use the arrow next to the checkbox in the Filtered Schedules table header to perform the following actions:

- **Select all on this page**: Select all items currently visible on the page.
- **Select all**: Select all items across all pages of the table.
- **Clear selected**: Deselect all previously selected items.

## Auto-hide previous results

Previously, when you selected Preview for an action on the Manage Revenue Schedules page and then switched to a different action, the previous Filtered Schedules table remained visible until you selected Preview again. Now, when you change actions, the previous Filtered Schedules table automatically hides.

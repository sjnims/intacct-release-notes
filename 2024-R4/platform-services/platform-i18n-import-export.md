- Several languages and locales from which to choose, including:
  - English (Australia)

## How it works

1.  Go to the **Platform Services > Applications**.
2.  Select an application that's not already installed.

Ensure that **Installed** is not selected.

4.  Depending on what you want to do, you can either import or export labels.

- If you select **Import**, you simply select a `.csv` file with the tokens that you want to import. A confirmation message appears when the import is complete.

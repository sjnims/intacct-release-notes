Company and Administration

Sage Collaborate helps your team communicate with real-time conversations directly on records. Instead of switching between emails and apps, you can now share updates, resolve issues, and stay informed—all in one place. This streamlined communication helps teams move faster and stay aligned.

## Key benefits

With Sage Collaborate, your team can:

-   Communicate instantly within the context of records, reducing the need for external messaging tools.
-   Resolve issues like missing documents or exceptions faster through real-time discussions.
-   Keep everyone on the same page with a centralized space for updates and collaboration.

## Sage Collaborate vs. Intacct Collaborate

Sage Collaborate is the evolution of Intacct Collaborate, representing the next generation of Sage's real-time communication tool.

Sage Collaborate currently offers the same core functionality as its predecessor—allowing teams to share information and track project developments directly on records within Sage Intacct.

Sage Collaborate is now available to all **new** companies.

All **existing** companies will be migrated from Intacct Collaborate to Sage Collaborate starting in November 2025. Companies will receive an alert in their company when they’re eligible for migration to Sage Collaborate.

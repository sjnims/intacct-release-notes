# Create your own value transformations in EMRConnect

Sage Intacct EMRConnect integrates data from your electronic medical records (EMR) or practice management system with Sage Intacct. By connecting financial and operational data, organizations can proactively manage costs and streamline processes—all in one easy-to-use platform.

Creating your own value transformations gives you more control over the information shown on the Value Transformations page. Sort and filter information, and change the order of columns to see exactly the information you want.

## How it works

1.  On the Value Transformations page, select **New EMR Value Transformation**.
2.  Enter information for the new value transformation.

Administrators can set default values on employee records so that those values appear on timesheets automatically using Sage Intelligent Time (SIT). Set default values for each employee to ensure consistent and accurate data entry and reporting.

## Key benefits

-   Values populate on timesheets automatically
    
-   Enter data quickly
    
-   Reduce manual errors
    
-   Enhance data integrity and compliance
    

## How it works

1.  Go to **Time** or **Expenses** > **All** > **Employees**.
    
2.  Find the employee and select **Edit**.
    
3.  Select dimensions to populate on the employee timesheet.
    
    [You can select the following dimensions](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2025/2025_Release_4/Expenses/2025-R4-set-default-values-on-timesheets.htm#)
    
    -   Customer
        
    -   Vendor
        
    -   Item
        
    -   Time allocation
        
    -   Expense distribution
        
    -   Department
        
    -   Location
        
    -   Class
        
    
4.  Select **Save**.
    

## What's changed

The following are new dimensions on the Employee information page:

-   Customer
    
-   Vendor
    
-   Item
    
-   Time allocation
    
-   Expense distribution
    

## Good to know

When an employee creates a timesheet, default values populate automatically based on their employee record. If a project is selected, the timesheet will instead use the project's default values, which override the employee defaults.

Get ready for the upcoming 1099 season. Learn about upcoming form and setup changes and check out the following resources to help you through the process.

-   [How to run the 1099 report](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Reports_1099)
    
-   [How to verify that your vendors are set up correctly](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Form_1099_Information_w_YTD) and that taxable amounts are as expected
    

If you have 10 or more forms to file, the IRS requires that you file electronically. Read our article about how to [e-file your 1099s with Sage Intacct and TaxBandits](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Efile_1099_overview).

If you only have a few forms to submit, you can [print forms](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Form_1099). Make sure to [order tax forms](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Order_1099_forms) from our supported vendor to guarantee correct printing alignment.

## Form changes

There are a few form changes for the 2025 tax year.

-   All 1099 forms now support a 2-digit calendar year instead of 4-digits.
    
    We already support this printing format, so processing steps remain the same.
    
-   Use 1099-NEC Box 3 for Excess golden parachute payments.
    
    This amount was previously reported in 1099-MISC Box 14. Update vendors and transactions tagged for excess golden parachute payments. [Read the release note](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2025/2025_Release_4/Tax/2025-R4-1099-box-migration.htm) and learn how to migrate information.
    

## Setup changes

This year, if your company is configured to issue a separate 1099 per entity, you need to assign each entity an entity contact for address information to print. [Read the release note](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/2025/2025_Release_4/Tax/2025-R4-entity-1099-contact-info.htm).

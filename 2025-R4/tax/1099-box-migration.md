Tax

Effective for the 2025 tax year, the IRS has updated the reporting requirements for excess golden parachute payments. These payments must now be reported in Box 3 of Form 1099-NEC. This information was previously reported using Box 14 on Form 1099-MISC.

## Action required

You'll need to do the following:

- Update vendors that currently point to 1099-MISC Box 14 so that they now use 1099-NEC Box 3.
- Update existing transactions and tag them for 1099-NEC Box 3.

Run the 1099 report to get an idea of which vendors need to be updated. Get started now by reading [this guide](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Migrate_1099_boxes_and_forms).

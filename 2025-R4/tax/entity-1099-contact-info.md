If your company is configured to issue a separate 1099 per entity, you now need to assign an entity contact at the entity level for the address to print on forms.

If an entity does not have an entity contact, address information does not print.

## Action required

Update your entity contact information.

1.  At the top level company, go to **Company** \> **Setup** \> **Entities** \> **Edit**.
2.  In the Contacts section, select a contact from the **Entity** drop down.
3.  Select **Save**.

Close Automation

You can now use Copilot to write the emails used to send insights through Close Workspace and Variance Analysis.

## Key benefits

- Save time by letting Copilot do the work.
- Copilot will adjust the length and tone of voice. Just ask.
- You can edit the drafts to make them just right.

## How it works

Draft with Copilot buttons appear on the following pages: 

- Configure Close Workspace
- Configure Copilot Variance Analysis

When email notifications are enabled, the **Draft with Copilot** buttons appear under the email template fields. Select this button to open the Email template page where you'll find an initial draft of an email message.

Use the **Adjust tone** and **Adjust length** fields to tell Copilot how to adjust the email message. You can make it long or shorter, and you can make it more formal or informal.

Each time that you select Generate, a new draft is created. Use the arrows to move back and forth between the drafts.

You can also edit the message text directly.

CONSTRUCTION

Sage Intacct Construction Payroll handles construction payroll complexities not found in general payroll solutions. It provides a complete view of your project costs with unprecedented visibility into each cost component.

This release includes the following new features and enhancements.

## More system pay modifier limits

We've added system pay modifier limits for the following limit values:

- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly
- Annual

## Improved registration process for the employee pay stub access portal

The improvements prevent scenarios where an employee would receive the password reset email but they were not seeing their check stubs.

## Enhancements in the Checks and Timecards pages

- Data is listed from largest to smallest.
- Sections are expanded, preventing data truncation.

## Updated Aatrix integration

We’ve incorporated changes to the Aatrix integration to break out cash fringe information per employee for the federal WH-347 certified payroll form.

## Improved performance

- Master records and check information within each of the payroll pages is retrieved faster.
- Additional fault tolerance when data is flowing from payroll to other modules and those records produce an error message.

accounts receivable

Introducing a better way to select which transactions you want included in your customer statements. Now, when you run open item customer statements, there are new transaction options for you to select from. These options provide more granularity and insight into which transactions will appear in the statement. The updated transaction options include the following:

-   Show all transactions
    
-   Show open invoices and credits
    
-   Show open invoices
    

## Key benefits

-   Updated transaction options help you easily identify and select which transactions will appear in the statement
    
-   New options allow you to include open invoices and credits or open invoices only
    
-   More clarity regarding what will appear in the statement without having to view it first

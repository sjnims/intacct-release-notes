# Customer payment service integrations have retired

Our customer payment service integrations with Authorize.net and PayPal retired on November 7, 2025.

This means that customer payment services and APIs for customer bank and credit card accounts are no longer supported to process payments.

## Action required

If you have any recurring invoices that are set up to process payments through one of these integrations, update the payment method to avoid payment issues on future invoices.

[Check out Versapay](https://www.versapay.com/lp/sage-offer), a Sage recommended solution, to continue accepting customer payments in Sage Intacct.

## Why the change

Sage is working to reduce the amount of cardholder data we manage. This decision is driven by a strategic goal to minimize the audit requirements associated with handling sensitive data. By exploring alternatives to storing and processing card data, we aim to enhance operational efficiency while maintaining the highest standards of security for customer information.

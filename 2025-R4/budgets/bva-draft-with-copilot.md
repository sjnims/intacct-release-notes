# Draft emails with Copilot for Variance Analysis

[Set up Variance Analysis](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Set_up_variance_analysis)

Budgeting and Planning

You can now use Copilot to write the emails used to send insights through Variance Analysis.

## Key benefits

- Save time by letting Copilot do the work.
- Copilot will adjust the length and tone of voice. Just ask.
- You can edit the drafts to make them fit your needs.

## How it works

A **Draft with Copilot** button appears under the email template fields.

![Notifications section of the Configure Copilot Variance Analysis page. The email template fields and Draft with Copilot buttons are highlighted. ](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/releasenotes/Resources/Images/2025/2025-R4-images/2025-R4-va-draft-with-copilot-1.png)

Select **Draft with Copilot** to open the Email template page where you'll find an initial draft of an email message.

Use the **Adjust tone** and **Adjust length** fields to tell Copilot how to adjust the email message. You can make it long or shorter, and you can make it more formal or informal.

Each time that you select Generate, Copilot creates a new draft. Use the arrows to move back and forth between the drafts.

You can also edit the message text directly.

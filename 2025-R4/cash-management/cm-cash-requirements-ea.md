# Introducing Cash requirements—Early Adopter

[About Cash requirements](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=About_cash_requirements)

Cash Management

Take our new Cash requirements feature for a test-drive and join the Early adopter program. View amounts for payables, receivables, and bank balances on a single page to help efficiently surface cash flow insights.

The Cash requirements feature is in testing and the data shown might not yet reflect your complete accounting records. Do not rely on this information for financial, tax, or business decisions.

## Key benefits

-   **Centralized cash flow view**: View a single-page summary of your payables, receivables, and bank balances for quicker cash flow insights.
    
-   **Cash flow insights**: Use cash requirements estimates to support your decision making.
    
-   **Customize your view**: Apply filters for forecast range and select only the bank accounts you want to include for a customized view of your cash flow information.

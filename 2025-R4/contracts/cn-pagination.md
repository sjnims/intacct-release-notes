# Faster page loading and navigation in Contracts

[Contracts field descriptions](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=Contract_fbf)

Contracts

Pagination now loads data in smaller chunks, and the redesigned Journal balances tab makes it easier to browse and manage contract details efficiently.

## Improved pagination

Intacct now loads rows page by page instead of all at once in the following areas of a contract, improving performance and navigation speed:

-   Contract lines section on the General tab
    
-   Evergreen history tab (for evergreen contracts only)
    
-   Transaction history tab
    

The number of rows displayed per page is determined by your **Rows per page** setting user preferences.

## Updates to the Journal balances tab

We redesigned the contract line sections of the Journal balances tab on contracts to improve usability.

-   **Combined tables:** The contract line sections are consolidated into a single table per journal.
    
-   **Pagination:** The new table design supports pagination for faster loading.
    
-   **Currency fields:** Transaction currency fields appear in the tables by default. Select **Show details** on a row to view the base currency fields.
    
-   **Custom layouts:** You can customize which fields appear in these tables by going to **More actions** > **Edit Contract line journal 1 balances layout** or **Edit Contract line journal 2 balances layout**.

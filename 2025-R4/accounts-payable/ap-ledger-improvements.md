# More filter options in the AP Ledger report

[AP Ledger report](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/en_US/help_action/Default.htm#cshid=AP_Ledger_Report)

Accounts Payable

This idea came from you

Enjoy more filtering flexibility in the AP Ledger report. New filtering options help you refine your report data to target specific vendors.

## Key benefits

- **Greater reporting efficiency**: Run the AP Ledger report for multiple vendors at once—no more generating reports one vendor at a time or manually editing large exports in Excel.
- **Flexible filtering options**: Select individual vendors or define custom groups based on criteria such as geography, industry, payment terms, or other vendor attributes. This allows for more targeted and relevant reporting.
- **Improved consistency**: The new filtering options mirror those already available in the Vendor Aging report, creating an intuitive experience across reporting tools.
- **Time savings**: Reduce the time spent preparing reports by eliminating repetitive steps and manual data cleanup. This is especially valuable if you manage high volumes of vendor data.
- **Enhanced accuracy**: By filtering directly within the report, you reduce the risk of errors introduced through manual editing or data manipulation outside Sage Intacct.

## How it works

New filter options include the following: 

- Multiple vendors: Select multiple vendors, individually or in ranges
- Vendor group: Include vendors based on an existing vendor group
- Include child vendors: When filtering by range a range of vendors, include child vendor in the report

Sage Copilot

We're excited to announce that Search help with Copilot is now available for content in all supported languages. This means you can now find the information you need more intuitively and accurately, regardless of the language your searching in.

## Key benefits

Search help with Copilot is designed to help you find information within the Sage Intacct Help Center and offers the following benefits:

- **Natural language understanding**: Copilot understands the nuances of Sage Intacct terminology and can interpret complex queries.
- **Increased efficiency**: Significantly reduces search time and the need for multiple searches by delivering more relevant results.
- **Intelligent recommendations**: Provides suggestions for related topics and articles to expand your knowledge.

## How it works

There's a new **Search help** option in the **Help & Support** menu.
